My personal preference for natural perfume is that it 'breathes' with the body; never overwhelms, yet synergises with our own unique chemistry in a slow-release of volatile plant essences that ‘bloom’ over a period of time. It’s the myriad of subtle complexities in natural perfume that really speaks to me.\" – Dr Teone Reinthal.\nTRNP, Teone Reinthal Natural Perfume, contains a wide variety of dynamic natural essences and raw materials that are seasonally harvested; each aromatic ingredient offering unique personality and individual life force. For Teone, this is the most precious feature of natural perfumes:- the fact that they are created from living plants. Exclusively designed and hand-made in Australia from premium botanical ingredients including pure essential oils, absolutes, tinctures and resins, these products do not contain pthalates nor any chemical additives (eg boosters, stabilisers, preservatives). As well as being the nose at TRNP, Teone is a visual artist and scholar, and has been a qualified clinical aromatherapist since 2001.

In a simple phrase our creations become life time friends of the beholder.\nOur house nose and master Al Shareef Jawed, trained by his grandfather in the traditional art of eastern perfumery, has a deep appreciation and understanding of the relationship fragrances have with each of us. He always mentions how our deepest memories are associated and imprinted by scents. As such fragrances aren’t just something we wash off, rather it travels with us sometimes for a life time.\nIn our Oudhs, Mukhallaats and Attar’s Al Shareef has coupled modern innovation with the traditional treasures of knowledge that were passed down in the family, to craft perfumery art reflecting tradition and projecting foresight to the future.\nOur oudhs oils are pure oils, each one is a complete perfume in its own right. They are a thing to behold, nothing the like of what one would find at a major brand, or any vendor for that matter. Our clients could pick up a blank bottle and identify our signature in our oils. Our Mukhallaats and Attars employ the most traditional formulas utilising advanced modern means to paint complete narratives in each one of our fragrances.
