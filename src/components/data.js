			"Daniel Barros, based in São Paulo, Brazil, decided to leave a solid career as a Marketing Director in the manufacturing industry to dedicate himself to fragrances, a childhood passion. He first studied perfumery for two years and then created his own company, Ego In Vitro – a consultancy service that helps people find the ideal fragrance according to their style and personality. At the same time, Daniel also published two perfume guides (male and female versions) available on Amazon in Portuguese only. A couple of years later, Daniel realized that he wanted more than just writing and recommending fragrances to clients, at the same time that clients also suggested him to start making his own fragrances. He then sought help from local artisan perfumers and started to mix natural and synthetic perfume ingredients on his own. Initially offering a bespoke service, Daniel finally decided to release a complete fragrance line in 2016 – the Barista Collection – with scents inspired in popular drinks.\nDaniel Barros is a new fragrance brand. Designer Daniel Barros has 15 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2016. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Daniel Barros.",

Our artisans work in an ecological way with high quality essential oils and plant extracts.\nOur mission is to manufacture 100% natural high quality products that improve the welfare of those who use them. This is accomplished through the utilization of ancestral aboriginal know-how in accordance with human values, Mother Earth and nature. We attune our products and the premises where they are manufactured with pristine vibratory energies in our will to accompany humanity in its evolution.\nOur ecological and humanitarian commitments include a social commitment to the Wendake First Nations where our plant is situated and to Native American Aboriginal communities everywhere. We value aboriginal spirituality, culture and values as we think they are essential in restoring global balance. This attitude is illustrated, amongst other decisions, in our investing in more people rather than automation. We energize prosperity to better serve our employees, our clients and humanity. Our philosophy and our teachings which arise from aboriginal wisdom are permanently implemented and promoted by the whole team. As in nature, this wisdom stream is in constant evolution so we flow with it to better serve our clientele and the world around us.\nTraditionally, burning sacred plants is used by all Native Americans to purify people and places. In 1996 Blue Eagle, a traditional shaman of Abenaki, Algonquin, Pawnee and French Canadian descent has difficulties working without the traditional smudging as is called the burning of sacred herbs, in the hospitals where he is called to look after Natives from the Far North. Inspired to find a solution without smoke with essential oil, he travels to France to meet the great perfumer from Ville de Grasse, Michel Roudnitska, creator of Black Spice at Frédéric Malle Perfumes. The father of Michel was also a great perfumer. Edmond Roudnitska created amongst other great fragrances Dior’s Eau Sauvage. Having received from Michel Roudnitska the methodology of high French perfumery, Blue Eagle returns to Quebec and works for 2 years at the creation of Invocation’s first Native Essence, CHIIYAAM. This natural perfume consists of essential oil and extracts stemming from sixteen different plants. Amazed by the efficiency of this therapeutic and shamanic fragrance that purifies and harmonizes the electromagnetic fields more powerfully than traditional smudging he wants to make it available to all.\nInvocation is a new fragrance brand.

When she was at boarding school she used to cut and style their her friends’ hair and do their make-up. She discovered early that beauty was my passion then, and it remained her passion till today!\nAn important part of her inspiration came from Helena Rubinstein’s biography. She started believed that her dream would come true eventually. Lise started working as the host of a series of television shows where women’s issues and concerns were discussed. Since she had her bake-up applied professionally every day, she learnt a lot about techniques and tips in cosmetics.\nAs Lise became more involved in women’s issues, she founded the Lise Watier Institute in 1968, with a wish to teach women some basic things about beauty, to give them advice on application and selection of make-up, on poise and personal fulfillment. The make-up artist believes that beauty comes from within and is best expressed though sincere smile and engaging conversation. She views beauty as a living thing, a presence; it commands attention.\nBy helping the women who visited Lise Watier Institute, Lise was discovering the fundamental principles which later developed into Lise Watier Cosmétiques in 1972. The aim of this cosmetics line that included make-up, skincare products and fragrances was to celebrate beauty and to increase woman’s self-confidence. This line as well as all others to come has to be of high quality, creativity, innovation and respect for Lise’s consumers.\nToday, Lise’s products are very popular and sought-after by women in Canada, France, the United States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nIt was in 2009 that Lise founded Lise Watier Foundation to provide hope and assistance to women who, in spite of their talent and dreams, found themselves on the streets, without friends, family, financial resources and college degree. She also helped women who suffered physical, verbal, or sexual violence, addiction problems, drug abuse, homelessness or other difficulties. This is a non-profit organization that facilitates financial assistance to talented women, supports them and provides a safe environment where they can regain confidence in themselves.\nAnother goal of the Foundation was to inaugurate the Lise Watier Pavilion, in association with the Old Brewery Mission. The Pavilion was opened in December 2010 and it serves as a home to homeless women who are trying to cross the bridge from homelessness to independence. One part of Lise’s revenue from specific products is donated to the Foundation.\nDesigner Lise Watier has 16 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1993 and the newest is from 2013.

With no formal training as a perfumer, but with a love for perfume instilled by his mother and a very talented nose, Daltroff set about creating what would go on to be one of the most enduring and beloved perfumes houses in the history of the fragrance industry.\nThe story of Parfums Caron is a story of secret love. Daltroff hired a former dressmaker, Felicie Wanpouille, to be the company's artistic adviser. Wanpouille oversaw the company's bottle design and packaging, and played an integral part in the company's success. Wanpouille was Daltroff's muse, and Daltroff was rumored to be smitten with her but never formally declared his love for her. The pair's great success and tremendous ambition, as well as the emotional undercurrents in their personal and professional relationship, resulted in some of the 20th century's most innovative and beloved perfumes.\nNarcisse Noir (1911) was the first scent from the house to gain notoriety. This iconic fragrance was later immortalized in the film \"Sunset Boulevard,\" cradled in the hands of screen siren Gloria Swanson. N'Aimez Que Moi (\"Love No One But Me\") is said by some to be a secret expression of affection between Daltroff and Wanpouille. (It's 1916 release also made it appropriate for soldiers to give their sweethearts as a forget-me-not.) Tabac Blond, introduced in 1919, was designed for the new style of woman emerging at the time—one who wasn't afraid to flaunt social conventions of the day by smoking cigarettes in public.\nMany are not as familiar with the other great product of this perfume house, a finely-milled luxury face powder, first introduced in the 1930s and still available today. The powder's manufacturing process is a closely-guarded secret.\nWith World War II and the Nazi's approaching, Daltroff, who was Jewish, fled to America to escape persecution, leaving Caron in Wanpouille's very capable hands. Daltroff never returned to Europe and passed away in 1947.\nWanpouille kept the house going, introducing new perfumes in collaboration with other perfumers and overseeing operations until her own death in 1967.\nPatrick Alès purchased Caron in 1998, and Romain Alès runs the company today.\nThe house of Caron is unique in that it continues to offer the original creations of Ernest Daltroff, many of which are still produced in the same or similar packaging today. Alongside the classic creations are the fragrances of Caron's in-house perfumer for more than 30 years, Richard Fraysse.\nCaron is also notable for offering beautiful refillable bottles of every size, with fragrances dispensed from beautiful Baccarat crystal fountains.\nDesigner Caron has 89 perfumes in our fragrance base.

She focused on fragrances, accessories and fashion and couture for petite women. Her elegant fashion creations that were inspired by travel and artistic motives featured lace and embroidery and were very feminine. By the end of the 1960s Carven also sold men's wear and a jewellery collection. From then it took a few years only until the brand had gathered a solid fan base. Her designs were particularly popular in Japan where women have always been rather petite. Japanese women appreciated that de Tommasso designed beautiful collections that would perfectly suit their shorter and slim body shapes.\nThe first fragrance under the brand name of Carven, Ma Griffe, was launched in 1946. The green chypre with floral notes has been a favorite for more than 60 years. The composition centers around aldehydes, gardenia, green notes, asafoetida, clary sage and citruses, orris, orange blossom, orris root, jasmine, ylang-ylang, lily-of-the-valley and rose, labdanum, sandalwood, cinnamon, musk, benzoin, oakmoss, vetiver and styrax.\nThe following year saw the launch of the company's second women's fragrance. Robe d'un Soir features notes that are reminiscent of many classic floral-aldehyde compositions: aldehydes, bergamot, mandarin, neroli, peach, carnation, jasmine, lily, orris root, may rose, ylang-ylang, amber, benzoin, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla and vetiver.\nCarven's first fragrance for men, Vetiver for men, was launched in 1957. The original composition is a woody-chypre one with dominant notes of lavender, mandarin orange, clary sage, petit grain, lemon, carnation, sandalwood, orris root, jasmine, vetiver, cedar, bergamot, amber, musk, oakmoss and myrrh.\nTo the delight of many women Carven presented a new fragrance for women in 1966. Eau Vive, the original from the 1960s has been relaunched in the 1990s. The reformulated floral-green fragrance is based on bergamot, mandarin, juniper berries, coriander, lavender, orange, lily of the valley, mimosa, apple, vetiver, rosewood, green leaves, rhubarb, vanilla and musk.\nAfter more than a decade a new fragrance was presented. Monsieur Carven, a floral chypre for men, was launched in 1978. This scent's counterpart, Madame de Carven, was presented in the following year. Either edition has been discontinued but Madame de Carven and Monsieur Carven are still greatly appreciated among vintage perfume lovers.\nIn 1982 Carven presented a ladies' fragrance that was composed by Robertet perfumers. This perfume, Guirlandes, features prominent white floral notes and accords of aldehydes, sandalwood and clove. The women's fragrance Intrigue was launched in 1986.

			"Fashion designer Christian Dior was born in France and rose to prominence in the fashion world with the creation of the \"New Look\"—voluminous dresses that emphasized a woman's curvy feminine shape.\nDior's fashion background included working for or alongside other well-known fashion (and perfume) legends of the mid-twentieth century. He entered the fashion business working for Robert Piguet, and later worked at Lucien Lelong with another up-and-coming designer, Pierre Balmain. Dior introduced the \"New Look\" in 1947. It represented a radical departure from the simple, fabric-conserving styles of World War II and was hugely influential in women's fashion, as well as helping to re-establish Paris as a fashion capital of the world.\nThe house of Dior issued perfumes to match its new fashions, launching company Parfums Dior and its first fragrance in 1947: Miss Dior, named for the designer's sister Catherine.\nChristian Dior passed away in 1957, but the fashion and perfume houses that bear his name live on. The Dior brand name is known worldwide for its haute couture collections, luxurious ready-to-wear fashions, cosmetics and fragrances. Today, Christian Dior is also the main holding company of multi-national luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.\nDesigner Christian Dior has 240 perfumes in our fragrance base. Christian Dior is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1947 and the newest is from 2020. Christian Dior fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Edmond Roudnitska, Beatrice Piquet, Guy Robert, Paul Vacher, Pierre Bourdon, Maurice Roger, Max Gavarry, Domitille Michalon Bertier, Jacques Cavallier, Jean Martel, Florence Idier, Nathalie Lorson, Francois Demachy, Thierry Wasser, Olivier Polge, Francis Kurkdjian, Jean-Louis Sieuzac, Nejla Barbir, Dominique Ropion, Olivier Cresp, Jean-Pierre Bethouart, Michel Almairac, Bertrand Duchaufour, Louise Turner, Olivier Gillotin, Olivier Pescheux, Nathalie Gracia-Cetto, Carlos Vinals, Calice Becker, Annick Menardo, François Demachy, Jean Carles, Christine Nagel, Edouard Flechier and Carlos Benaim.",

		title: "Christian Lacroix",
		description:
			"Christian Lacroix is a French fashion designer who founded the house that bears his name. Born and raised in Arles, and displaying an early talent for art, Lacroix originally studied art history, with designs on a career as a museum curator. His entrance into fashion would come with a job as an assistant at Hermès, starting in 1978. From there, LaCroix collaborated with the Tokyo Imperial Court on costumes, and eventually found his way to Jean Patou in 1981.\nWith his feet firmly in the fashion world, LaCroix left in 1986 to launch his own house. His colorful and elaborate designs, often featuring mulitple patterns, elaborate ruffles, poufs and pleats, Lacroix's designs for many are the epitome of the over-the-top fashions of the 1980s. Praised for their beauty, sex appeal and sumptuous fabrics, and criticized at the same time for their impracticality, Lacroix's couture designs managed to make a name for the designer without earning him a lot of money. He expanded into ready-to-wear a year later, along with jewelry, handbags, shoes, glasses, scarves and ties. Lacroix boutiques were opened in Paris, Arles, Aix-en-Provence, Toulouse, London, Geneva and Japan. The designer launched his first menswear collection in 2004, and also served as Creative Director of Pucci from 2002 to 2005.\nChristian Lacroix produced his last collection of haute couture in 2009. The company went into administration in 2010 and is now under the direction of Sacha Walckhoff.\nChristian Lacroix fragrances were an extension of the designer's colorful, eccentric and over-the-top style, beginning with 1990's C'est La Vie, packaged in an unusual-shaped bottle with a coral branch stopper, in a bright pink box. A series of sea-shell bottles were used for Christian Lacroix for Women, Eau Florale and Eau Florale Bleue. Christian Lacroix fragrances were produced in conjunction with Inter Pafums Inc.\nIn 2007, the designer also began a partnership with Avon to release a series of perfumes for men and women (Rouge, Noir, Absynthe, Nuit), in vividly-colored bottles stamped with elaborate designs.\nDesigner Christian Lacroix has 14 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1990 and the newest is from 2008. Christian Lacroix fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Bertrand Duchaufour, Emilie (Bevierre) Coppermann, Jean-Claude Ellena, Michel Girard, Jean Jacques, Edouard Flechier, Sophia Grojsman, Nathalie Lorson, Beatrice Piquet, Pascal Gaurin, Yves Cassar, Laurent Le Guernec, Carlos Benaim, Francoise Caron and Nathalie Gracia-Cetto.",

		title: "Clarins",
		description:
			"Jacques Courtin-Clarins founded the cosmetics brand Clarins in 1954 when he was a medical student. He noticed that many female patients reported various skin problems and he seized the opportunity to set up his own cosmetics business. The brand name, Clarins, was not part of his surname, but the name of a character he played in a school play several years ago. Eventually, he changed his surname from Courtin to Courtin-Clarins.\nClarins began their successful journey with the sales of perfumed body oils that were made from botanical ingredients while advising their customers to massage their skins in order to treat existing skin conditions. The product range was expanded rapidly when the business took on. Clarins was the first cosmetics brand to manufacture oils, creams and other products from natural ingredients only, which has been part of the company's appeal since the 1950s.\nIn 1970 Clarins, by then a renowned cosmetics brand in France, started to break into international markets. The company's famous concept of using natural raw materials only (which, at that time, was almost unheard of in the beauty sector's corporate head offices) proved an instant hit with customers from all over the world. In 1981 Clarins had conquered the American market and, due to ever increasing sales figures, they set up the brand's first subsidiary in the USA. By the end of 2011 19 Clarins subsidiaries were reported to be operating from different countries all over the world.\nBy 1990 Clarins was one of the best selling and successful high end cosmetic and beauty brands. Their product portfolio was grown significantly and the company offers a range of moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners and other products for facial care, body care products, sun creams and fake tans, make-up and nail care products, fragrances and several products for men.\nClarins offer a range of fragrances that are effective treatment fragrances. Eau des Jardins is a refreshing fragrance that is packed with moisturizing agents. Eau Dynamisante firms and tones skin while it offers a dynamic, fresh and invigorating scent. Clarins Sunshine Fragrance oozes \"radiance, refreshment and fun\".\nThe Clarins Frangrance Group, established in the 1990s, is Clarins' prestige fragrance branch. Clarins produces fragrances for several fashion and lifestyle brands. Among them are Porsche Design, Azzaro, Thierry Mugler, Swarovski, Zadig & Voltaire and David Yurman.\nDesigner Clarins has 9 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1987 and the newest is from 2012. Clarins fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Jacques Courtin-Clarins, Nathalie Feisthauer and Raphael Haury.",

			"André Courrèges is a French fashion designer, characteristic for his ultra-modern designs. He was educated in civil engineering and later moved to Paris to work at Geanne Lafaurie fashion design house. His next famous employer was Spanish designer Balenciaga. The collaboration lasted for ten years.\nIn 1961 Courrèges opened his own fashion house - Maison de Couture. It is here that he started working in a different direction and creating his unique style. His most famous designs were miniskirt, little white dress and trouser suit.\nHis great breakthrough was the 'Space Age' collection launched in 1964. The name is appropriate because the shapes of his clothes were geometric: squares, trapezoids, triangles. The look included boots, goggles, and hems three inches above the knees. This unusual boxy, uncluttered look was a hit in the fashion industry.\nThe materials mere also untypical of clothing – such as plastic, PVC and metal, which went perfectly with primary colors used in his collections: metallic, white, red, yellow... Even though younger audience was thrilled with the modern lines, the designer’s primary customers have always remained mature and older women.\nAmong Courrèges other great designs that can be singled out from his collections were sweater pants, parkas, tennis dresses, beach clothes and mechanic-style coveralls. A line of swimsuits held together only by thin strings was also a hit. His bright acid colors and geometrical designs – his trademarks were often imitated and taken over by high-street retailers.\nThe designer usually names modern architecture, technology, new fabrics, and modernism and futurism in art and design as his main influences in creation which pushed him to produce some truly memorable designs.\nToday the house of Courrèges also offers accessories, luggage and perfume in addition to his clothing ranges.\nDesigner Courreges has 30 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1970 and the newest is from 2020.
