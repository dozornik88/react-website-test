			"Daniel Barros, based in São Paulo, Brazil, decided to leave a solid career as a Marketing Director in the manufacturing industry to dedicate himself to fragrances, a childhood passion. He first studied perfumery for two years and then created his own company, Ego In Vitro – a consultancy service that helps people find the ideal fragrance according to their style and personality. At the same time, Daniel also published two perfume guides (male and female versions) available on Amazon in Portuguese only. A couple of years later, Daniel realized that he wanted more than just writing and recommending fragrances to clients, at the same time that clients also suggested him to start making his own fragrances. He then sought help from local artisan perfumers and started to mix natural and synthetic perfume ingredients on his own. Initially offering a bespoke service, Daniel finally decided to release a complete fragrance line in 2016 – the Barista Collection – with scents inspired in popular drinks.\nDaniel Barros is a new fragrance brand. Designer Daniel Barros has 15 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2016. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Daniel Barros.",

Our artisans work in an ecological way with high quality essential oils and plant extracts.\nOur mission is to manufacture 100% natural high quality products that improve the welfare of those who use them. This is accomplished through the utilization of ancestral aboriginal know-how in accordance with human values, Mother Earth and nature. We attune our products and the premises where they are manufactured with pristine vibratory energies in our will to accompany humanity in its evolution.\nOur ecological and humanitarian commitments include a social commitment to the Wendake First Nations where our plant is situated and to Native American Aboriginal communities everywhere. We value aboriginal spirituality, culture and values as we think they are essential in restoring global balance. This attitude is illustrated, amongst other decisions, in our investing in more people rather than automation. We energize prosperity to better serve our employees, our clients and humanity. Our philosophy and our teachings which arise from aboriginal wisdom are permanently implemented and promoted by the whole team. As in nature, this wisdom stream is in constant evolution so we flow with it to better serve our clientele and the world around us.\nTraditionally, burning sacred plants is used by all Native Americans to purify people and places. In 1996 Blue Eagle, a traditional shaman of Abenaki, Algonquin, Pawnee and French Canadian descent has difficulties working without the traditional smudging as is called the burning of sacred herbs, in the hospitals where he is called to look after Natives from the Far North. Inspired to find a solution without smoke with essential oil, he travels to France to meet the great perfumer from Ville de Grasse, Michel Roudnitska, creator of Black Spice at Frédéric Malle Perfumes. The father of Michel was also a great perfumer. Edmond Roudnitska created amongst other great fragrances Dior’s Eau Sauvage. Having received from Michel Roudnitska the methodology of high French perfumery, Blue Eagle returns to Quebec and works for 2 years at the creation of Invocation’s first Native Essence, CHIIYAAM. This natural perfume consists of essential oil and extracts stemming from sixteen different plants. Amazed by the efficiency of this therapeutic and shamanic fragrance that purifies and harmonizes the electromagnetic fields more powerfully than traditional smudging he wants to make it available to all.\nInvocation is a new fragrance brand.

When she was at boarding school she used to cut and style their her friends’ hair and do their make-up. She discovered early that beauty was my passion then, and it remained her passion till today!\nAn important part of her inspiration came from Helena Rubinstein’s biography. She started believed that her dream would come true eventually. Lise started working as the host of a series of television shows where women’s issues and concerns were discussed. Since she had her bake-up applied professionally every day, she learnt a lot about techniques and tips in cosmetics.\nAs Lise became more involved in women’s issues, she founded the Lise Watier Institute in 1968, with a wish to teach women some basic things about beauty, to give them advice on application and selection of make-up, on poise and personal fulfillment. The make-up artist believes that beauty comes from within and is best expressed though sincere smile and engaging conversation. She views beauty as a living thing, a presence; it commands attention.\nBy helping the women who visited Lise Watier Institute, Lise was discovering the fundamental principles which later developed into Lise Watier Cosmétiques in 1972. The aim of this cosmetics line that included make-up, skincare products and fragrances was to celebrate beauty and to increase woman’s self-confidence. This line as well as all others to come has to be of high quality, creativity, innovation and respect for Lise’s consumers.\nToday, Lise’s products are very popular and sought-after by women in Canada, France, the United States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nIt was in 2009 that Lise founded Lise Watier Foundation to provide hope and assistance to women who, in spite of their talent and dreams, found themselves on the streets, without friends, family, financial resources and college degree. She also helped women who suffered physical, verbal, or sexual violence, addiction problems, drug abuse, homelessness or other difficulties. This is a non-profit organization that facilitates financial assistance to talented women, supports them and provides a safe environment where they can regain confidence in themselves.\nAnother goal of the Foundation was to inaugurate the Lise Watier Pavilion, in association with the Old Brewery Mission. The Pavilion was opened in December 2010 and it serves as a home to homeless women who are trying to cross the bridge from homelessness to independence. One part of Lise’s revenue from specific products is donated to the Foundation.\nDesigner Lise Watier has 16 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1993 and the newest is from 2013.

With no formal training as a perfumer, but with a love for perfume instilled by his mother and a very talented nose, Daltroff set about creating what would go on to be one of the most enduring and beloved perfumes houses in the history of the fragrance industry.\nThe story of Parfums Caron is a story of secret love. Daltroff hired a former dressmaker, Felicie Wanpouille, to be the company's artistic adviser. Wanpouille oversaw the company's bottle design and packaging, and played an integral part in the company's success. Wanpouille was Daltroff's muse, and Daltroff was rumored to be smitten with her but never formally declared his love for her. The pair's great success and tremendous ambition, as well as the emotional undercurrents in their personal and professional relationship, resulted in some of the 20th century's most innovative and beloved perfumes.\nNarcisse Noir (1911) was the first scent from the house to gain notoriety. This iconic fragrance was later immortalized in the film \"Sunset Boulevard,\" cradled in the hands of screen siren Gloria Swanson. N'Aimez Que Moi (\"Love No One But Me\") is said by some to be a secret expression of affection between Daltroff and Wanpouille. (It's 1916 release also made it appropriate for soldiers to give their sweethearts as a forget-me-not.) Tabac Blond, introduced in 1919, was designed for the new style of woman emerging at the time—one who wasn't afraid to flaunt social conventions of the day by smoking cigarettes in public.\nMany are not as familiar with the other great product of this perfume house, a finely-milled luxury face powder, first introduced in the 1930s and still available today. The powder's manufacturing process is a closely-guarded secret.\nWith World War II and the Nazi's approaching, Daltroff, who was Jewish, fled to America to escape persecution, leaving Caron in Wanpouille's very capable hands. Daltroff never returned to Europe and passed away in 1947.\nWanpouille kept the house going, introducing new perfumes in collaboration with other perfumers and overseeing operations until her own death in 1967.\nPatrick Alès purchased Caron in 1998, and Romain Alès runs the company today.\nThe house of Caron is unique in that it continues to offer the original creations of Ernest Daltroff, many of which are still produced in the same or similar packaging today. Alongside the classic creations are the fragrances of Caron's in-house perfumer for more than 30 years, Richard Fraysse.\nCaron is also notable for offering beautiful refillable bottles of every size, with fragrances dispensed from beautiful Baccarat crystal fountains.\nDesigner Caron has 89 perfumes in our fragrance base.

She focused on fragrances, accessories and fashion and couture for petite women. Her elegant fashion creations that were inspired by travel and artistic motives featured lace and embroidery and were very feminine. By the end of the 1960s Carven also sold men's wear and a jewellery collection. From then it took a few years only until the brand had gathered a solid fan base. Her designs were particularly popular in Japan where women have always been rather petite. Japanese women appreciated that de Tommasso designed beautiful collections that would perfectly suit their shorter and slim body shapes.\nThe first fragrance under the brand name of Carven, Ma Griffe, was launched in 1946. The green chypre with floral notes has been a favorite for more than 60 years. The composition centers around aldehydes, gardenia, green notes, asafoetida, clary sage and citruses, orris, orange blossom, orris root, jasmine, ylang-ylang, lily-of-the-valley and rose, labdanum, sandalwood, cinnamon, musk, benzoin, oakmoss, vetiver and styrax.\nThe following year saw the launch of the company's second women's fragrance. Robe d'un Soir features notes that are reminiscent of many classic floral-aldehyde compositions: aldehydes, bergamot, mandarin, neroli, peach, carnation, jasmine, lily, orris root, may rose, ylang-ylang, amber, benzoin, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla and vetiver.\nCarven's first fragrance for men, Vetiver for men, was launched in 1957. The original composition is a woody-chypre one with dominant notes of lavender, mandarin orange, clary sage, petit grain, lemon, carnation, sandalwood, orris root, jasmine, vetiver, cedar, bergamot, amber, musk, oakmoss and myrrh.\nTo the delight of many women Carven presented a new fragrance for women in 1966. Eau Vive, the original from the 1960s has been relaunched in the 1990s. The reformulated floral-green fragrance is based on bergamot, mandarin, juniper berries, coriander, lavender, orange, lily of the valley, mimosa, apple, vetiver, rosewood, green leaves, rhubarb, vanilla and musk.\nAfter more than a decade a new fragrance was presented. Monsieur Carven, a floral chypre for men, was launched in 1978. This scent's counterpart, Madame de Carven, was presented in the following year. Either edition has been discontinued but Madame de Carven and Monsieur Carven are still greatly appreciated among vintage perfume lovers.\nIn 1982 Carven presented a ladies' fragrance that was composed by Robertet perfumers. This perfume, Guirlandes, features prominent white floral notes and accords of aldehydes, sandalwood and clove. The women's fragrance Intrigue was launched in 1986.

			"Fashion designer Christian Dior was born in France and rose to prominence in the fashion world with the creation of the \"New Look\"—voluminous dresses that emphasized a woman's curvy feminine shape.\nDior's fashion background included working for or alongside other well-known fashion (and perfume) legends of the mid-twentieth century. He entered the fashion business working for Robert Piguet, and later worked at Lucien Lelong with another up-and-coming designer, Pierre Balmain. Dior introduced the \"New Look\" in 1947. It represented a radical departure from the simple, fabric-conserving styles of World War II and was hugely influential in women's fashion, as well as helping to re-establish Paris as a fashion capital of the world.\nThe house of Dior issued perfumes to match its new fashions, launching company Parfums Dior and its first fragrance in 1947: Miss Dior, named for the designer's sister Catherine.\nChristian Dior passed away in 1957, but the fashion and perfume houses that bear his name live on. The Dior brand name is known worldwide for its haute couture collections, luxurious ready-to-wear fashions, cosmetics and fragrances. Today, Christian Dior is also the main holding company of multi-national luxury goods conglomerate LVMH.\nDesigner Christian Dior has 240 perfumes in our fragrance base. Christian Dior is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1947 and the newest is from 2020.

		title: "Christian Lacroix",
		description:
			"Christian Lacroix is a French fashion designer who founded the house that bears his name. Born and raised in Arles, and displaying an early talent for art, Lacroix originally studied art history, with designs on a career as a museum curator. His entrance into fashion would come with a job as an assistant at Hermès, starting in 1978. From there, LaCroix collaborated with the Tokyo Imperial Court on costumes, and eventually found his way to Jean Patou in 1981.\nWith his feet firmly in the fashion world, LaCroix left in 1986 to launch his own house. His colorful and elaborate designs, often featuring mulitple patterns, elaborate ruffles, poufs and pleats, Lacroix's designs for many are the epitome of the over-the-top fashions of the 1980s. Praised for their beauty, sex appeal and sumptuous fabrics, and criticized at the same time for their impracticality, Lacroix's couture designs managed to make a name for the designer without earning him a lot of money. He expanded into ready-to-wear a year later, along with jewelry, handbags, shoes, glasses, scarves and ties. Lacroix boutiques were opened in Paris, Arles, Aix-en-Provence, Toulouse, London, Geneva and Japan. The designer launched his first menswear collection in 2004, and also served as Creative Director of Pucci from 2002 to 2005.\nChristian Lacroix produced his last collection of haute couture in 2009. The company went into administration in 2010 and is now under the direction of Sacha Walckhoff.\nChristian Lacroix fragrances were an extension of the designer's colorful, eccentric and over-the-top style, beginning with 1990's C'est La Vie, packaged in an unusual-shaped bottle with a coral branch stopper, in a bright pink box. A series of sea-shell bottles were used for Christian Lacroix for Women, Eau Florale and Eau Florale Bleue. Christian Lacroix fragrances were produced in conjunction with Inter Pafums Inc.\nIn 2007, the designer also began a partnership with Avon to release a series of perfumes for men and women (Rouge, Noir, Absynthe, Nuit), in vividly-colored bottles stamped with elaborate designs.\nDesigner Christian Lacroix has 14 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1990 and the newest is from 2008. Christian Lacroix fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Bertrand Duchaufour, Emilie (Bevierre) Coppermann, Jean-Claude Ellena, Michel Girard, Jean Jacques, Edouard Flechier, Sophia Grojsman, Nathalie Lorson, Beatrice Piquet, Pascal Gaurin, Yves Cassar, Laurent Le Guernec, Carlos Benaim, Francoise Caron and Nathalie Gracia-Cetto.",

			"Jacques Courtin-Clarins founded the cosmetics brand Clarins in 1954 when he was a medical student. He noticed that many female patients reported various skin problems and he seized the opportunity to set up his own cosmetics business. The brand name, Clarins, was not part of his surname, but the name of a character he played in a school play several years ago. Eventually, he changed his surname from Courtin to Courtin-Clarins.\nClarins began their successful journey with the sales of perfumed body oils that were made from botanical ingredients while advising their customers to massage their skins in order to treat existing skin conditions. The product range was expanded rapidly when the business took on. Clarins was the first cosmetics brand to manufacture oils, creams and other products from natural ingredients only, which has been part of the company's appeal since the 1950s.\nIn 1970 Clarins, by then a renowned cosmetics brand in France, started to break into international markets. The company's famous concept of using natural raw materials only (which, at that time, was almost unheard of in the beauty sector's corporate head offices) proved an instant hit with customers from all over the world. In 1981 Clarins had conquered the American market and, due to ever increasing sales figures, they set up the brand's first subsidiary in the USA. By the end of 2011 19 Clarins subsidiaries were reported to be operating from different countries all over the world.\nBy 1990 Clarins was one of the best selling and successful high end cosmetic and beauty brands. Their product portfolio was grown significantly and the company offers a range of moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners and other products for facial care, body care products, sun creams and fake tans, make-up and nail care products, fragrances and several products for men.\nClarins offer a range of fragrances that are effective treatment fragrances. Eau des Jardins is a refreshing fragrance that is packed with moisturizing agents. Eau Dynamisante firms and tones skin while it offers a dynamic, fresh and invigorating scent. Clarins Sunshine Fragrance oozes \"radiance, refreshment and fun\".\nThe Clarins Frangrance Group, established in the 1990s, is Clarins' prestige fragrance branch. Clarins produces fragrances for several fashion and lifestyle brands. Among them are Porsche Design, Azzaro, Thierry Mugler, Swarovski, Zadig & Voltaire and David Yurman.\nDesigner Clarins has 9 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1987 and the newest is from 2012. Clarins fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Jacques Courtin-Clarins, Nathalie Feisthauer and Raphael Haury.",

			"André Courrèges is a French fashion designer, characteristic for his ultra-modern designs. He was educated in civil engineering and later moved to Paris to work at Geanne Lafaurie fashion design house. His next famous employer was Spanish designer Balenciaga. The collaboration lasted for ten years.\nIn 1961 Courrèges opened his own fashion house - Maison de Couture. It is here that he started working in a different direction and creating his unique style. His most famous designs were miniskirt, little white dress and trouser suit.\nHis great breakthrough was the 'Space Age' collection launched in 1964. The name is appropriate because the shapes of his clothes were geometric: squares, trapezoids, triangles. The look included boots, goggles, and hems three inches above the knees. This unusual boxy, uncluttered look was a hit in the fashion industry.\nThe materials mere also untypical of clothing – such as plastic, PVC and metal, which went perfectly with primary colors used in his collections: metallic, white, red, yellow... Even though younger audience was thrilled with the modern lines, the designer’s primary customers have always remained mature and older women.\nAmong Courrèges other great designs that can be singled out from his collections were sweater pants, parkas, tennis dresses, beach clothes and mechanic-style coveralls. A line of swimsuits held together only by thin strings was also a hit. His bright acid colors and geometrical designs – his trademarks were often imitated and taken over by high-street retailers.\nThe designer usually names modern architecture, technology, new fabrics, and modernism and futurism in art and design as his main influences in creation which pushed him to produce some truly memorable designs.\nToday the house of Courrèges also offers accessories, luggage and perfume in addition to his clothing ranges.\nDesigner Courreges has 30 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1970 and the newest is from 2020.

Today the firm is guided by the unerring Olivier CREED, sixth in his family line to head CREED and creator of its most popular scents. His son, Erwin, 30, seventh generation and future head, has already begun to contribute to the art of CREED.\nCREED was founded in London in 1760 by James Henry CREED. The firm’s first royal commission came in 1781 from King George III, for whom CREED made the scent Royal English Leather.\nCREED relocated to Paris in 1854 at the request of client Empress Eugenie of France, for whom CREED made Jasmin Imperatrice Eugenie, a fragrance still offered today. CREED also served her husband, Napoleon III. Among other CREED clients at this time are Emperor Franz-Josef of Austria-Hungary, his stylish wife, Empress Elisabeth (“Sisi”) and Czar Nicolas II of Russia.\nIn 1885, Queen Victoria appointed CREED “official supplier” to the British royal court. For her majesty, CREED created the scent Fleurs de Bulgarie by commission. This engaging scent, rich with roses, is available today. Also in 1885, Queen Maria Cristina of Spain named CREED her supplier by royal order.\nIn the 20th century, not only did royalty including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor choose CREED, but also leading politicians became CREED clients. Sir Winston Churchill wore CREED’s Tabarome. In America, young Congressman and future President John F. Kennedy wore CREED’s Vetiver.\nIn 1956, CREED created Grace Kelly’s wedding day scent, Fleurissimo, by order of her fiancé, Prince Rainier of Monaco.

The company was very successful and there were many wonderful perfumes created. Some of them, including the legendary perfume created by Alfred d'Orsay himself (Etiquette Bleu) are present in the modern line of d'Orsay perfumes.\nCount d'Orsay has been the \"face\" of the house since it was founded. His legendary love story, aristocratic elegance and trend-setting taste were the best possible advertisement for their fine products. No matter how close the meanings of \"aristocracy\" and \"luxury\" had been in the human history, at the begining of the 20th century people felt the painful difference between them.\nIn February 2007 the house was acquired by Marie Huet, who was attracted by the history of the house and fell in love with the precious d'Orsay fragrances.

			'Frederic Malle is the man behind the niche fragrance house Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle. Born in Paris in 1962 to a family in the perfume industry (Grandfather Serge Heftler founded Christian Dior Perfumes, and Frederic\'s mother later worked as an Art Director for the same perfume house), Frederic was exposed to the inner workings of the industry at a tender age.\nInitially choosing to study Art History in New York, Frederic made a change in 1986 and accepted a position at the famed perfume lab Roure Bertrand Dupont. At Roure, Frederic learned about raw ingredients, composition and all aspects of perfume creation from some of the finest professionals in the business.\nFrederic collaborated with another "nose," Pierre Bourdon, on Mark Birley for Men in 1996. After working in the industry for more than 15 years, Frederic was ready to embark on a new adventure.\nIn 2000, using his connections and experience in the industry, Frederic invited nine top perfumers to create their own original perfumes, with complete creative freedom and with no financial restrictions regarding ingredients or technologies. These fragrances were packaged in bottles that feature the name of the perfumer—a first in the industry, where the perfumer is traditionally behind the scenes and credit for the scent is given to the fashion house or celebrity on the bottle. The perfumes were marketed at a specially-designed store that featured photos of each perfumer and refrigerated cabinets for storage and presentation of the scents. (Later, the perfumes were also distributed in partnership with select department stores around the world.)\nThe end result was a smashing success, with the original nine perfumes now legendary in the industry, and with the perfumers behind each creation finally getting the recognition they deserved. Frederic Malle, who describes himself as an "editor of perfumes" has since worked with other top perfumers in the industry (whom he refers to as "authors of perfumes") to "publish" more Editions. Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle has expanded to offers candles, innovative home scents, soap and body care products, all created with the same freedom as the first nine fragrances.\nDesigner Frederic Malle has 42 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2000 and the newest is from 2019. Frederic Malle fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Jean-Claude Ellena, Dominique Ropion, Maurice Roucel, Bruno Jovanovic, Carlos Benaim, Olivia Giacobetti, Pierre Bourdon, Edmond Roudnitska, Ralf Schwieger, Edouard Flechier, Michel Roudnitska, Sophia Grojsman, Fanny Bal and Julien Rasquinet.',

			'Madame Alix Grès (née Germaine Emilie Krebs) was born in 1903 in Paris, France. She desired to be a sculptor, but without a fruitful career, she soon switched to women\'s hat-making. Her first fashion house, "Alex Couture," opened in 1934 and was her shift towards couture.\nMadame Grès designed her gowns in the fashion of a sculptor—directly on the bodies of her models. Very soon she became famous and her name became a synonym for elegance—"The Star of Elegance." She created garments for royal families, aristocracy and the celebrities of her time: Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Vivien Leigh and others. One of her first muses was Isadora Duncan.\nSeveral years after marrying Russian painter Serge Czerefkov (1937) the famous creator changed her name to Madame Grès in 1942, as it was an anagram of her husband\'s name and also his alias. Soon after they got married, her husband left France for French Polynesia and "forgot to return."\nDuring World War II and the German occupation of France, Madame Grès, patriotic to the core, was creating clothes around the three colors of France—blue, white and red. The first perfume of the Grès house, Cabochard, was created in 1958, after Madame Grès returned from a trip to India. Cabochard was inspired by a new generation of perfumes, including Tabac Blond (1919), Cuir de Russie (1924), Scandal (1933), and Bandit (1944).\nIn 1982 Madame Grès had to sell her perfume business for the sake of her Haute Couture house. The company Parfums Grès changed hands several times until it was finally bought by Silvio Denz in 2001. Today Parfums Grès is based in Switzerland. The first perfume launched by the new owner was Cabaret (2003), after which comes Cabaret Homme (2004) and Caline (2005).\nMadame Grès died in 1993 in her house in the South of France, but her death was not announced until a year later, on December 14, 1994 in Le Monde.\nDesigner Gres has 58 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'Guerlain is a legendary French perfume house with 175 years of outstanding business, passion and tradition. Guerlain has always used luxurious and rare materials for its perfumes, such as French vanilla or ylang-ylang from their own plantations in Comoro Islands. Beside that, Guerlain has been an innovator in use of synthetic materials: Jicky (1889) was the first perfume to which Aimé Guerlain added a synthetic component—coumarin.\nThe Guerlain house was founded by Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain in 1828. Starting with common hygiene products, Guerlain was also creating perfumes for his customers, and over time he developed the business into a highly successful company that became an official perfumer for several European royal courts.\nAfter he died, his son Aimé Guerlain became the main perfumer. His famous perfume Jicky, created in 1889, became the first "modern" perfume. It is also believed that it was he who created the so-called "Guerlinade"—the Guerlain signature base notes used for creation of multiple Guerlain perfumes.\nHis nephew Jacques Guerlain was the next nose of the Guerlain house. He created some of the most well-known perfumes of the house, including L\'Heure Bleue (1912), Mitsouko (1919) and Shalimar (1925), which is one of the best loved perfumes of all time.\nJean-Paul Guerlain is the grandson of Jacques Guerlain. He first assisted, and then created his first "solo" offering, the now-famous Vetiver (1959). His other well-known creations include Habit Rouge, Chamade, Eau de Guerlain and Nahema.\nThe Guerlain perfume house was a family business until 1994, when it was acquired by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH). In 2002, the family legacy of Guerlain ended with Jean-Paul Guerlain\'s retirement, though he continues to work for the house as a consultant. Thierry Wasser was named the official in-house perfumer of Guerlain in 2008.\nThe flagship Guerlain boutique in Paris was thoroughly renovated and reopened in June 2005.

The designs were appreciated for their practicality and wearability, and Laroche was one of the first designers to introduce separates to the American market. Laroche began offering men's fashions in 1966.\nThe company's first foray into perfumes began with legendary Fidji for women, in 1966.

Since then, fragrance has followed fragrance, each signed by the great names of perfume design. The arrival of Jean-Claude Ellena, in 2004, as the in-house perfumer for Hermès, was a decisive step. As an artist of olfactory emotion, an aesthete who goes beyond scale and material, he shares Hermès' sense of craftsmanship and expertise.\nThe encounter between Edmond Roudnitska and Émile Hermès (grandson of founder Thierry Hermès) gave birth to Eau d’Hermès, which remains one of the crowning glories of French perfumery.\nIn 1961, at the prompting of Jean-René Guerrand (son-in-law of Émile Hermès and founder of the fragrances branch), the perfumer Guy Robert composed Calèche, a masterpiece which instantly transformed Hermès into one of the major players of modern perfumery. Nine years later, moreover, he would be the author of Équipage, the House's first perfume for men.\nThe most recent encounter with Jean-Claude Ellena, was embodied in the creation of Un Jardin en Méditerranée in 2003, and then in 2004 with his official appointment as exclusive perfumer of the House. Since then, the deep affinity that has been established between the perfume designer and Hermès has continued to bear fruit, as if confirming the essential rightness of their mutual involvement.

He was raised in a creative family of fashion illustrators, writers and landscape painters.\nFath was very interested in fashion and creation, so he stepped into the world of haute couture by presenting his first collection in 1937. He owned a fashion salon which changed several locations in Paris: he started on Rue de la Boetie, then Rue Francois Premier and finally at 39 Avenue Pierre 1er de Serbie in 1944. He worked with many famous models and created very successful collections. The designer educated himself and learned his craft from studying museum exhibitions and books about fashion. He was later a teacher to numerous young designers who worked as his assistants and apprentices, such as Hubert de Givenchy, Guy Laroche and Valentino Garavani.\nFath was known as the \"little prince of Paris Haute couture in the 1950's.” This innovative designer was a favorite to the chic young Parisienne, since he was using unusual materials such as sequins made of walnut and almond shells. Some of his clients were Ava Gardner, Greta Garbo, and Rita Hayworth.\nFath died of leukemia in 1953 and the house continued functioning until 1957. His widow ran the house during that time and had one successful fashion collection created with help of her husband’s associates. The haute couture collections were discontinued and the house turned to production of perfumes, gloves, hosiery and other accessories.\nJacques Fath Paris developed into an alternative brand by the house of Jacques Fath, aiming at a younger audience. It follows the trends and chooses an expressive style. Their first fragrance was launched back in 1953. So far, the house presented several fragrances, including Jacques Fath L'Homme (1998), Yin (1999), Yang (1999), Fath de Fath (1953, reformulated and relaunched in 1993), Chasuble (1945), Expression (1977), Canasta (1950), Iris Gris (1946), Fath's Love (1968), and Green Water (1947). The fragrances wre produced under license by L'Oréal until 1992.\nThe house and its products were relaunched by the France Luxury Group in 1992, and then purchased in 1996 by the Banque Saga Group.

The first collection that he presented in the French capital in 1989 was part of Paris Fashion Week. Still, Galliano could not avoid bankruptcy and eventually moved to Paris in 1990.\nWith the help of Anna Wintour and a few investors Galliano was soon back in the haute couture world. In 1995 he joined Givenchy, part of the LVMH group, as a designer and presented his critically acclaimed first collection for Givenchy in the following year. Only 15 months after joining LVMH he was moved to Dior, the company is he mostly associated with. He has been with Dior for 15 years until 2011 when he faced criminal charges and, eventually, was found guilty of giving public insults on account of race.\nFrom the mid 1990s until early 2011 he was designing several collections, some of them haute couture and some of the ready-to-wear, for the house of Dior and his own successful label. Galliano ventured into the world of perfumes in 2008 with his first fragrant offering "John Galliano by John Galliano". This EDP is often referred to as mystical or "Goth" and centers around prominent accords of incense, violet, iris, aldehydes, angelica, patchouli and rose. An EDT version of this fragrance was launched in 2010 shortly before the presentation of Parlez-Moi d\'Amour. Parlez-Moi d\'Amour EDT is a feminine fragrance that is based on blueberry and rose. In 2011 an EDP version was launched.\nDesigner John Galliano has 10 perfumes in our fragrance base. John Galliano is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2008 and the newest is from 2015.

			"Karl Lagerfeld (born Karl Lagerfeldt) is a German-born artist and fashion designer now based in Paris. Famously elusive about the details of his personal life, he is believed to have been born in the 1930s. His fashion career got off to a prestigious start in 1955 when he was awarded an apprenticeship at Pierre Balmain. He moved on to Jean Patou just three years later, and remained there for five years, designing two haute couture collections each year. His early designs were controversial for their low necklines, low backs and short skirts. Poorly received by critics, the collections nonetheless made a name for Lagerfeld and allowed him to begin working as a freelance designer for such varied houses as Tiziana, Chloe, Curiel and Fendi. In 1983, he took over as creative director for Chanel, where he remains today.\nLagerfeld created his own line in 1984 and designed for it until 1997. Lagerfeld Gallery brand was launched in 1998, and has had successful collaborations with Diesel and H&M. The Lagerfeld collection with H&M sold out in just two days. The line changed its name back to Karl Lagerfeld in 2006, and began partnerships with Macy's and Sephora.\nKarl Lagerfeld is also an accomplished photographer who shoots ad campaigns for Chanel, Fendi and his own line each year. Lagerfeld has also photographed models and celebrities for magazines, and has books of his photos and illustrations published. Lagerfeld's distinct image, with his signature ponytail, dark glasses and gloves, has been immortalized in jewelry, art, dolls, stuffed animals and puppets.\nFragrances have been available under the Karl Lagerfeld name since 1978, when Lagerfeld Classic for men was first launched. His women's fragrances Sun, Moon, Stars was an iconic and hugely successful fragrance of the 1990s. Today, Karl Lagerfeld fragrances are produced in collaboration with Tommy Hilfiger.\nDesigner Karl Lagerfeld has 28 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Kenzo is credited with bringing Japanese fashion to the rest of the world, and his unique designs represent a mix of traditional Japanese lines with influences of nature and multi-culturalism.\nThe Kenzo Parfums division was launched in 1987, though evidence of the earliest Kenzo perfume—1978's King Kong, in keeping with the \"Jungle Jap\" theme—suggests the designer was interested in fragrance prior to launching a separate fragrance division. Kenzo Parfums' first official release was 1988's Kenzo for Women, a scent whose name was later changed to ça sent beau (which translates to \"it smells nice\"). A series of successful fragrances for men and women have since been offered, including the company's flagship scent, the ground-breaking Flower by Kenzo.\nKenzo Parfums joined multi-national luxury goods conglomerate LVMH in 1993, and Kenzo Takada officially retired from the company in 1999, though he has since reappeared as a designer of home decor and furnishings.\nDesigner Kenzo has 132 perfumes in our fragrance base.

The word \"L'Occitane\" means \"the woman from Occitania,\" which is a region in southern Europe (the Southern half of France, Monaco, parts of Italy and Spain) where Occitan was historically the main language spoken. Hoping to recreate the traditions of the region he called home, Baussan purchased a steam-distiller—then an outdated piece of equipment—and produced his own rosemary essential oil from wild rosemary he harvested himself. The oil sold well at local markets, and was the beginning of the idea that would eventually become L'Occitane En Provence.\nBaussan opened the first L'Occitane boutique in Volx, a small village in Provence. He happened upon an unused soap factory in Manosque, another village in Provence, and took it over for the purpose of making vegetable-based soaps using traditional Provençal methods and ingredients.\nIn the 1990s, a majority stake in the business was sold to fund further expansion, and it eventually wound up in the hands of Reinold Geiger, who partnered with Baussan to expand the company internationally. \"En Provence\" was added to the company's name in the late 1990s, to enhance the connection between the company's products and Provence for international customers. Today, L'Occitane En Provence has shops in more than 80 countries.\nThe company is known for its body care products, perfumes and home scents produced using traditional Provence methods and locally-sourced ingredients, such as lavender, rosemary, rose and immortelle. The company encourages traditional agriculture and cultivation in the region. L'Occitane en Provence also supports Fair Trade with women's groups from Burkina Faso who harvest Shea Butter using traditional methods.

			"Lalique is a French glasswear design house founded by artist, master ceramist and jeweler René Lalique. Born in the small village of Ay in 1860, and raised in both Paris and Ay, young René developed a fascination with the natural world which would fully express itself in later artworks. He formally studied art at College Turgot, but was forced to leave when his father passed away. At age 12, he began an apprenticeship with a Parisian goldsmith, catching classes in the evening when he could. He was able to further his education at Sydenham Art College in London.\nHe returned to England and worked as a freelance artist, while also designing jewelry for esteemed houses such as Cartier and Boucheron, before embarking on his own business in 1885. Jewelry at the time placed an emphasis on the quantity of precious stones in a piece, with the design being less important. Lalique changed the course of jewelry forever with this nature-inspired pieces that depicted animals and the female form. One of the best-known (and most-plagiarized) jewelers of the celebrated \"Art Nouveau\" period, Lalique eventually turned his focus from jewelry to glassware, with even greater success.\nLalique partnered with Francois Coty to develop beautiful vessels for perfume&mash;a revolutionary concept at the time. Perfume at the time was sold in ordinary glass vials, and the women who purchased it also had to purchase ornate and expensive decanters for their home if they wanted to store it in a more attractive vessel. Lalique designed the now-legendary containers and beautiful labels for some of Coty's early successes, such as L'Effleur and Ambre Antique. Lalique's other stroke of brilliance was in designing a manufacturing process which enabled production of the bottles on a massive scale, thereby reducing the cost and making the product more affordable and widely available.\nThis new concept of marketing perfume in beautiful vessels caught on, and Lalique would go on to design bottles for Roger & Gallet, Guerlain, Molinard, d'Orsay and Worth, among others. One of his most memorable creations is the beautiful dove flacon for Nina Ricci's L'Air du Temps.\nGlass became the medium in which Lalique concentrated his efforts for the rest of his life. Not limited to simply perfume bottles, he also designed architectural installations and hood ornaments for luxury automobiles.\nLalique passed away in 1945, but his artistic talent was passed down through generations. Lalique's granddaughter Marie-Claude, who was also a glass-maker, decided to create her own line of perfume in 1992, reviving her grandfather's tradition of offering perfume in beautiful vessels. The fragrances are produced in conjunction with Art & Fragrance, and since 1994, luxurious limited editions of the company's scents have been offered in sculptural bottles each year.\nDesigner Lalique has 83 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			"Just after the French Revolution, Pierre François Lubin founded his Perfume House, at rue Sainte Anne in Paris. He provided perfumed ribbons, ball masks, and rice powders to the “Incroyables” and “Merveilleuses.” His most famous creation however was the “Eau Vivifiante,” later called “Eau de Lubin.” The fragrance soon won him the favour of the Imperial court, and so began Lubin’s renown, thanks to Empress Joséphine and Pauline Bonaparte, Princess Borghèse. When the Bourbon monarchy was restored, the perfumer dedicated his fragrances to Queen Marie-Amélie.\nThanks to these gentle ladies, the crowned heads of Europe began to trust Lubin. Among his documents are proudly displayed the Coats of Arms of France, the King of England, and the Russian Tsar. He also added the American Eagle to his list, as he was the first perfume maker to conquer the New World in 1830. From the banks of the Mississippi to the palaces of India, his fragrances would soon be famous the world over.\n  Designer Lubin has 41 perfumes in our fragrance base. Lubin is an old perfume house.

			"Mauboussin is a French company that was founded in 1827 by M. Rocher and J. Noury. They specialized in the manufacture of unique and exquisite jewellery from the very beginning. By the end of the 1870s their \"artistic\" jewellery pieces had been presented on trade fairs in Paris and Vienna, thus giving the brand a wider exposure and establishing the house of Mauboussin as one of the most exquisite jewellery houses.\nIn 1925 the house of Mauboussin was awarded an award during the \"Exposition des Arts Décoratifs\" for their ongoing efforts to integrate artistic influences into modern jewellery. By the early 1930s they had successfully exhibited their pieces dedicated to gemstones. One exhibition centered around emeralds, another was all about rubies while the third one was dedicated to diamonds. Those exhibitions cemented Mauboussin's reputation as one of the most exquisite jewelers.\nDuring the war times of the 1940s gold was even more difficult to acquire and the jewelers made their pieces from other materials. By the mid 1950s Mauboussin had opened their first boutique in Paris in France that carried more affordable pieces of jewellery.\nEach new decade influenced the house's designs in different ways. While during the 1940s the designers had to be extremely creative to make jewellery without gold, the protests and the new anti-conformist views of the 1960s and the 1970s inspired the jewelers to design new shapes. In the 1980s the focus was on uniting the contrasts between light and shadow in beautiful and timeless jewellery pieces that expressed the individuality of the brand. A new era began when, in the same decade, the house of Mauboussin started to design and manufacture exquisite watches for women and men. It was the year 2000 that saw the launch of the houses first fragrance, the self-titled Mauboussin for women. This fragrance is the company's signature and has been loved by many women for more than a decade. New fragrant offerings, including a fragrance for men, have since then been presented by Mauboussin on a regular basis. In 2008 Mauboussin opened their first boutique in New York. The following year saw the company open two shops in Tokyo, Japan and Singapore in Indonesia.\nToday Mauboussin is regarded as the French equivalent to Tiffany's and is one of the big five global jewellery brands.\nDesigner Mauboussin has 29 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'Molinard is a French perfume house founded in 1849 in Grasse. This region in the south of France is considered the birthplace (and today, cradle) of the modern perfume industry. Molinard is one of the oldest family companies in continuous existence, and remains an entirely family-run business even today.\nMolinard originally manufactured Eaux de Fleurs (flower-scented waters) and Eaux de Cologne, marketing them from their small store in the heart of Grasse.\nIn 1860, Molinard gained attention with two new perfumes—"Jasmin" and " Rose." Both were introduced in elegant crystal bottles designed and produced by Baccarat. This same strategy was used later for perfumes "Mimosa" and "Violette." Versions of three of these soliflore fragrances are still produced by Molinard today. Queen Victoria was rumored to be a devotee of Molinard Eaux de Cologne.\nIn 1900, Molinard expanded with the purchase of an old perfume factory whose structure had been designed by Gustave Eiffel (designer of the famous Eiffel Tower in Paris). This site remains their headquarters today. The new space allowed Molinard to open a formal showroom, decorated with a magnificent collection of 17th and 18th century furniture, for receiving important customers. Molinard\'s beautiful showroom and striking fragrances were favorites of many wealthy English and Russian travelers in the early 20th century.\n1921 was an important year for the house. Molinard created two products that are still popular even today: Habanita, a perfume originally developed as a cigarette flavor/fragrance, and which would become an actual perfume that would go down in history as one of the greatest creations starting in 1924. The other significant development of 1921 was the production of Molinard\'s "Concréta," the world\'s first solid perfume compacts, which incorporated natural flower wax as a fragrance component.\nBottle design has long been an important component of the Molinard aesthetic. In 1920, Viard, a famous bottle designer, created some beautiful scent bottles for Molinard. In 1930, with the successes of Habanita and the Concréta under its belt, Molinard hired famous master glassmaker René Lalique, who created and signed for Molinard the stunningly beautiful bottles for Iles d\'Or and Madrigal in 1930 and Le Baiser du Faune in 1932. Later in the 1930s, the Baccarat crystal workshops created and produced for Molinard the perfume bottles for a number of their fragrances. The legacy of Molinard\'s beautiful bottles continues today, with the ornate vessels of Molinard de Molinard and the current Habanita bottle.\nWorld War II was as challenging a time for Molinard as for all of France. Molinard invented "the Prisoner\'s parcel" to help bring comfort to French prisoners. The company endured and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949.\nMolinard today produces perfumes, soaps, body care products, candles and aromatherapy products. The company offers stores and tours through its Grasse, Nice and Lille locations, and markets products through secondary outlets throughout France and the rest of the world. The 160th anniversary of this esteemed house was celebrated in 2009 with the launch of a commemorative perfume, 160, a floral scent with both classic and modern touches. The president of Molinard today is the fourth generation of his family to oversee the company, Jean-Pierre Lerouge-Benard.\nDesigner Molinard has 112 perfumes in our fragrance base. Molinard is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1849 and the newest is from 2020. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Mathieu Nardin.',

			'The perfume house of Parfums Montale was founded by Pierre Montale in 2003 in Paris. Pierre Montale spent some time in Saudi Arabia prior to that, where he created perfumes for nobility, kings and queens. When he returned to Paris, the perfumer introduced his amazing oriental creations to the Western world. The mysterious East, Arabia and the perfumer\'s love for them can be found in each bottle of the Montale collection.\nMontale creates his fragrances from natural materials of high-quality, in large concentration, which makes the fragrances very intense and long-lasting. The aluminum bottle was specially created to protect the precious essences from light.\nMontale creates men\'s, women\'s and unisex fragrances, the main components of which are precious varieties of trees, such as incense, aoud (agarwood), cedar, sandalwood and many other materials used by Arabian perfumers. A special place in his collection belongs to perfumes created of aoud or agarwood. Oud Pafums Montale is the first French line of perfumes dedicated to aoud, a royal ingredient in the real sense of this word, and considered an aphrodisiac in East.\nAoud is an aromatic resin—oleoresin (other names are: aggor, agarwood, eagleswood, aloeswood, in Arabian: oud or oudh). Oleoresin is the product of an immunogical reaction of the Aquillaria tree to the Phialophora parasitica mold. When the tree is infected, it produces this precious, dark, aromatic resin in the heart of its trunk. Oud and its extracts are very expensive. Its value is estimated as being 1.5 more expensive than gold, so it is also called "liquid gold" or "the wood of gods."\nDesigner Montale has 139 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Making upscale pens in Hamburg, a pen produced in 1910 would later give the company its new name: the Montblanc.

The company's first fountain pen gained notoriety for the company was a fountain pen) known as the Meisterstück (\"Masterpiece\"), first produced in 1924 and still manufactured today. The success of the Meisterstück allowed for international expansion and export of the company's goods.

In 1934 the company changed its name to Montblanc-Simplo GmbH, and introduced its first piston pen filler.\nBy 1935, the company had expanded its offering to include leather goods such as pen pouches, notebooks and writing cases to accompany its pens. The company's manufacturing facilities were destroyed during World War II but were re-built, with production continuing in Denmark while construction took place.\nMeisterstück pens continued to be produced and improved upon, and remain a cornerstone of the company's business, although other models have been introduced. Interest in fountain pens was renewed in the 1980s, which allowed Montblanc to expand into Asia.

It is “an encounter between contemporary artistic photography and perfumery; between the eye and the nose…It is at the crossroads of a photographic studio and a perfume design studio”.\nThe inspiration for the first three perfumes of the collection is topics of self-portrait, dark chamber and still life, transformed into fragrances Autoportrait, Chambre Noire and Still Life.\nCeline Verleure first conceived the names of the perfumes, then gave freedom to three different photographers to showcase their interpretation of the same, and then these images served as inspirations for the perfumers who created the compositions.\nDesigner Olfactive Studio has 18 perfumes in our fragrance base. Olfactive Studio is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2011 and the newest is from 2019. Olfactive Studio fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Nathalie Lorson, Dorothee Piot, Annick Menardo, Olivier Cresp, Jerome Epinettee, Sidonie Lancesseur, Mylene Alran, Clement Gavarry, Thomas Fontaine, Dora Baghriche, Bertrand Duchaufour and Dominique Ropion.",

Born in 1914 to a family in the fashion and design industry (his father operated a drapery business and his mother and sister ran a fashion boutique), young Pierre abandoned his architecture studies and opted to pursue a career in fashion. He worked for Molyneux in the 1930s, and joined famed fashion house Lucien Lelong in the 1940s. By the end of World War II, Balmain was ready to open his own fashion house.\nEqually at home with tasteful suits or opulent evening gowns, Balmain designed for the new post-war woman, showcasing bell skirts and nipped waists. His clothing was popular with celebrities and wealthy clients of the era, and Balmain expanded his collection to include Ready-to-Wear in American boutiques. He is also noted for his costume designs for stage and screen, for which he was nominated for a Tony award and won the Drama Desk award.\nPerfumes have been offered by Balmain since the 1940s, with the introduction of Elysées 64-83 (his phone number) in 1945. 1947's legendary scent Vent Vert, still in production today, was one of the best-sellers of the 1940s and 1950s. Balmain's Jolie Madame was iconic in its representation of the new post-war 1950s woman. Revlon purchased the Balmain fragrance license in 1960, and Balmain fragrances are produced today in conjunction with Empire of Scents. The license for fragrances will transfer to Inter Parfums Inc. in 2012.\nPierre Balmain passed away in 1982. Longtime Balmain designer Erik Mortensen led the house until 1993, when Oscar de la Renta served as Creative Director. Olivier Rousteing was named Creative Director in 2011.

Surviving a difficult childhood, she would become in just a few years a very pretty young woman, determined to succeed and hungry for knowledge. In order to finance her studies, she accepted a position under the famous hairdresser Alexandre de Paris, becoming his main assistant.\nAs assistant to one of the most prominent hairstylists in Paris, Marina rubbed elbows with some of Europe's wealthiest, most powerful and famous names. Having conquered this social circle with her charm and intelligence, she was invited to St. Tropez. While living there, she met her Prince: André of the Bourbon of Parma Family. Together they returned to Paris and were eventually married in 1960.\nShortly after her marriage, Marina began her career as an Interior Designer, providing her clients with art objects for their homes and offices. Celebrities and European aristocrats relied on her for her impeccable taste.\nLonging for a new creative outlet, Princesse Marina wished to create perfume and signed a license with Gilles Pommereau. To support her new venture, she opened her concept store in Paris, on the Boulevard de Courcelles, known throughout the world for its eclectic objects of decor and clothing lines. The Princesse can often be found in residence at the boutique, where she is happy to present her perfume line, along with other luxury products. Many fragrances in the line refer to royalty and elite status. Others pay homage to her French heritage.

			"Robert Piguet is a French perfume house founded by couturier Robert Piguet. Born in Switzerland and destined for a career in finance, Piguet chose to depart for Paris at age 17, against his family's wishes, to pursue a career in fashion. Piguet found employment at Redfern, and then with influential early 20th century fashion designer Paul Poiret.\nWith experience at two important fahion houses under his belt, Piguet struck out on his own in 1933. His fashions for women were elegant in their simplicity, perfectly cut, reserved and conservative for daytime and colorful and flamboyant for nighttime. By 1938, Piguet's success enabled the opening of a new luxuruious salon on the Champs Elysses. Piguet's personal charm and aristocratic manner made him the toast of the wealthy elite as well as the arts and theatrical crowd. During his period of greatest success, Piguet employed some of the 20th century's best-known fashion designers before they rose to fame. Hubert de Givenchy, Pierre Balmain, Christian Dior and James Galanos all took a turn at the house of Piguet. Piguet's fashion house was tremendously successful until it closed in 1951, and his influence on women's fashions lives on through the designers he helped train and through the iconic perfumes launched under the Robert Piguet brand.\nPiguet met famed perfumer Germaine Cellier in the 1940s and worked with her to create perfumes that suited his elegant and modern post-war fashions. The first scent, Bandit, a leathery chypre launched in 1944, was introduced in conjunction with Piguet's runway collection that featured women in masks, with toy guns and knives, evoking a \"bad boy\" image.\nThe pair collaborated again on 1945's Visa (along with Jean Charles) and 1947's Fracas, deemed by many to be the quintessential tuberose fragrance.\nBaghari was introduced in 1950, and was the last fragrance created before Piguet's death in 1953. The fashion house closed in 1951, but the Robert Piguet brand name continued to launch fragrances into the 1960s, with Cravache and Futur.\nOwnership of the Robert Piguet brand and fragrances changed hands several times before reaching Fashion Fragrances & Cosmetics in the 1990s. They sought to reintroduce the Piguet brand name as a luxury fragrance brand, and to offer versions of the original fragrances that adhered as closely as possible to the formulas and fragrances of the original scents, using modern ingredients and with slight updates for modern sensibilities. As a result, many of the classic Piguet fragrances have been made available again to the public, and new scents under the Piguet name have also been introduced.\nDesigner Robert Piguet has 37 perfumes in our fragrance base. Robert Piguet is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1944 and the newest is from 2019.

From 1925 until 1953, when the haute couture division closed its doors, Marcel Rochas dressed women in forward-thinking fashions that also celebrated traditional feminine silhouettes. Anticipating the needs of modern women in the early-to-mid 20th century, Rochas was the first to design 2/3-length coats and skirts with pockets. He also created the \"mermaid\" dress, which continues to inspire women's dress designs today.\nThe company expanded its offerings to include fragrances, starting with a trio of perfumes, Avenue Matignon, Air Jeune and Audace, in 1934. The perfumes were taken off the market during World War II, but the company's most famous fragrance, the classic Femme, was launched in 1943 and remains a perennial best-seller. Rochas was an early adapter of the cross-sale and marketed lipstick and stockings as companion pieces to Femme. The company's first men's fragrance, Moustache, was launched in 1949.\nThe Rochas fragrance and cosmetics division was an enormous success, and Marcel Rochas closed the haute couture division in 1953, before passing away in 1955. With fragrances now the main focus, Rochas' young wife Helene, who was just 30 years old at the time of his death, took the helm and turned the house of Rochas into a multi-million-dollar company before selling it in 1971.\nThe company changed hands several times during the late 20th century. Helene Rochas even returned as a consultant from 1984 to 1989. Proctor and Gamble acquired the company in 2003, and re-launched the fashion division, under the direction of Olivier Theyskens from 2003 to 2006.

The "Golden Age of Travel" that began at the end of the 19th century soon developed a market for luxurious suitcases, trunks and travel accessories that could transport the precious cargo of the wealthy in style while enduring journeys that took several weeks or month. S.T. Dupont rose to the occasion, offering some of the era\'s finest luggaeg and travel cases. This aesthetic was further refined when the founder\'s sons, André and Lucien, began designing one-of-a-kind travel cases that purportedly cost "as much as a house," in the words of one S.T. Dupont employee.\nThe brothers opened a hotel that catered to the company\'s well-heeled clientele, and in 1923, a second S.T. Dupont workshop was opened in Faverges, France, the family’s home town. To this day, S.T. Dupont products continue to be hand-crafted in this very same place.\nIn 1929, their luxurious travel gear became available in America through Cartier\'s boutiques.\nInnovation in the company continued during the difficult years of World War II, when S.T. Dupont invented the first pocket gas lighter, whose improved design would later be patented in 1952. This model, the Ligne 1, is still a best-seller today and remains a worldwide status symbol.\nThe company went on to design exlcusive luggage for the future Queen Elizabeth of England, and screen legend Audrey Hepburn.\nThe brand took a new direction in 1973 with the production of its first luxury pen, the Classique, made of silver. The company also experienced a renaissance of its classic luxury goods—watches, leather goods, cuff links, which it continues to produce today. The 135th anniversary of the brand was celebrated in 2007.

During her first pregnancy, Sonia Rykiel discovered she could find no soft, comfortable maternity sweaters that suited her style. She used a Venice-based supplier to her husband's store to design her own creations. She began selling her pieces in Laura, her husband's boutique, and it is her sweaters and knitwear which would eventually be her key to fame and fortune in the fashion world.\nThe pullover sweater is Rykiel's signature piece, and Rykiel has taken it in every possible direction. She opened her first boutique under her own name in 1968. She was dubbed \"Queen of Knits\" by Women's Wear Daily in 1970.\nRykiel's innovations with the sweater include putting the seams on the outside, creating sweaters with no hem, creating loose knits designed to be worn with lining, creating very long and very short sweaters, and knitting words into sweaters. Rykiel has described her own designs as \"la demodé\" (\"the unfashion\") and she encouraged women to adopt a look that suits their individual personalities rather than following the dictates of couturiers.\nRykiel has earned numerous accolades and has authored nine books, in addition to her work as a designer. Now in her 80s, she remains active as the Honorary President of Sonia Rykiel.\nDaughter Nathalie Rykiel has followed her mother into the fashion world, first as a model, then with staging fashion shows for the Rykiel house. She started the company's children's line, Rykiel Enfant in 1983, during her own pregnancy, and initiated the secondary line, Sonia by Sonia Rykiel, in 1989.

		description:
			"Edmond \"Ted\" Lapidus was a Parisian designer born to Russian immigrant parents in 1929. The son of a tailor, Lapidus completed an apprenticeship with Christian Dior before launching his own brand in 1951, at age 22.\nLapidus joined the Chambre syndicale de la haute couture (the French high fashion designers' trade union) in 1963, after which he more fully came into his own.\nLapidus fashions offered a distinct unisex style that was much in-demand in the revolutionary 1960s. Lapidus designs often featured safari themes and military elements such as epaulettes on the shoulders. He is widely credited with helping to popularize blue jeans in mainstream fashion. Lapidus fashions were popular with influential stars of the day, including Twiggy, Alain Delon, Brigitte Bardot and the Beatles, in particular John Lennon. The white suit worn by Lennon on the cover of the Beatles album \"Abbey Road\" was designed by Lapidus. Lapidus persuaded Twiggy to don a suit and tie instead of her typical mini-skirts.\nLapidus is also notable for utilizing mass market production techniques, thereby making his fashions more affordable to the average consumer.\nThe Ted Lapidus brand expanded into accessories in the 1970s, as interest in haute couture began to fade. One of the earliest designers to form a partnership for the production of fragrances, Lapidus first collaborated with L'Oreal in 1970 to offer fragrances under the Ted Lapidus brand.\nIn 1989, Lapidus's son Oliver took over the house. In 2000, the Lapidus label officially ended its couture division and focused exclusively on accessories and fragrances. Ted Lapidus passed away in 2008.\nVu was the first fragrance, a men's scent which appeared in 1975 when the fragrance license was held by L'Oreal. The fragrance license for Ted Lapidus transferred to the Jacques Bogart Group in 1983.\nDesigner Ted Lapidus has 34 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1975 and the newest is from 2019.

Born and raised in the village La Gacilly, in the Brittany region of France, Rocher never strayed far from his roots. The company he founded maintains an ongoing commitment to the region with its headquarters and a botanical garden based on La Gacilly.\nRocher got his start in the botanical beauty business when a local healer showed him how to make a skin ointment using plants native to the region. Rocher marketed the ointment with ads in French magazines, setting the stage for the direct sales process which was to be an important piece of his business model.\nOne of the first companies to use botanical ingredients as the basis for its cosmetics, skincare products and fragrances, and with a goal of making botanical beauty accessible to all women, the company was launched from a \"laboratory\" in Rocher's attic in 1959. The products sold well, and the company was able to open its first store just three years later.<p<>The Yves Rocher empire has expanded around the world and its products are currently available in 88 countries, marketed through direct catalog sales, the internet and brick-and-mortar Yves Rocher stores. The company is one of the largest employers in the La Gacilly region.\nRocher officially retired from the company in 1992, passing control to his son Didier.

			"Yves Saint Laurent is the French fashion house founded by Yves Henri Donat Mathieu-Saint-Laurent. The house and designer are often abbreviated as YSL.\nLaurent's career in fashion began at the tender age of 17, when he served as assistant to Christian Dior. With Dior's death four years later, Laurent was named head of the house of Dior at just 21 years of age. Still a young man when the Algerian War of Independence broke out, Laurent was drafted into the army in 1960 and lost his position at Dior. Military service and despair over the loss of his design position resulted in a hospital stay. After a brief period of recuperation, Laurent started his own fashion company and went on to become one of the most influential fashion designers of the 1960s and 1970s.\nLaurent became known for his exquisitely-tailored women's suits, and is credited with creating the first women's tuxedo. The first designer to announce his expansion from couture into ready-to-wear, he is credited with making chic ready-to-wear fashions available to the mass market, and for making ready-to-wear a reputable business for designers. Laurent's ready-to-wear line was sold in boutiques named Rive Gauche, which would later be commemorated with a perfume.\nYves Saint Laurent remained active as the collection's main designer through the late 1980s. After his retirement, a series of designers including Alber Elbaz, Tom Ford and Stefano Pilati have produced collections for the brand. Yves Saint Laurent passed away in 2008.\nCosmetics and perfumes have long been included in the designer's offerings. The house's first fragrance, Y for women, was launched in 1964. Y and several other launches by YSL, including Rive Gauche (1970), Opium (1977), men's scent Kourous (1981), and Paris (1983) have become modern classics of the perfume world and remain best-sellers. The company continues to earn new fans with contemporary releases such as Baby Doll (2000), Elle (2007) and La Nuit de l'Homme (2009).

A contemporary pharmacopeia for adventurous souls in search of surprise, dazzle, as well as creation. AETHER is a tribute by its creators to synthetic molecules and the frenzy of chemistry. Olfactory kamikaze, elementary molecules explode each of the perfumes into a bizarre abstraction, a beautiful stranger. The nose, which clings to unknown ingredient is first caught by surprise and then submits to pure emotion: the discovery, the first day, the first time. If each molecule has a rather distinctive smell, who could guess exactly what the smell of the aldehyde C12 or ISO E Super would be? Sometimes a shimmering bubble and sometimes dazzling beauty, the molecule - this almost nothing in infinity - is the sacred young muse of the collection. At ÆTHER, no flower-show or flight of lyricism around the historically traditional raw material; rather the evocation of metallic vegetation, unknown woods, imperceptible sounds, moments to come ... These scents of imperial fancy do not envy the wake of others, but prefer a luminous halo, a magical ring, an aura of humor and mystery.\nDesigner Aether has 13 perfumes in our fragrance base.

She was the first person to use thermal plankton in effective skin care products designed to tackle all sorts of skin problems.\nBiotherm managed to establish a solid product portfolio and a profound customer relationships which played a significant role when the company became part of the L'Oréal group, one of the global players in the cosmetics and skin care sector. With the help of L'Oréal and effective and easy-to-use products, Biotherm expanded into several European countries before setting foot on Asian markets.\nBiotherm are always working on new products and develop powerful skin care products based on natural ingredients.

Many famous faces, among them Elle MacPherson, Sasha Pivovarova or Tyson Ballou, have endorsed the brand's products.\nThe company believes that different skin problems require different solutions. Several collections that focus on oily, dry, dull or aging skins have been developed in order to provide every customer with products targeted to their individual needs.\nBiotherm, so far known for their expertise in skin care, ventured into the world of fragrances in 1997. Their primary goal was to offer an effective body care spray that would nourish and hydrate the skin while awakening the senses with the help of scent. Their first fragrant offering, Eau Vitaminée, is composed of grapefruit, orange, jasmine, freesia and musk. Eau d'Energie, the follow-up on Eau Vitaminée, was presented in 2007. This floral-fruity body care spray features notes of mandarin, orange, citrus nuances, apricot, jasmine, cyclamen, cedar and musk. This fragrant body spray was made to make the wearer feel full of energy while hydrating the skin.\n2008 saw the launch of Eau Pure, a refreshing and caring body spray, composed by Nathalie Lorson of fresh citrus notes, kiwi, rhubarb and aromatic accords. Biotherm Homme Force, the brand's first body spray for men, and Eau de Paradis, another fragrant skin care spray for women, hit the shelves in 2010. L'Eau by Vanessa Bruno, a collaboration between Biotherm and the French fashion designer, was presented in 2011.\nDesigner Biotherm has 14 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1997 and the newest is from 2019.

		title: "Brecourt",
		description:
			'Brecourt is a French niche perfumery founded by perfumer Emilie Bouge in 2010.\nBRECOURT is confidentially connected to the personality of her creator, who wanted to express freely her art around two requirements: the tradition of the raw materials and the modernity of the formulation. Indeed, it is necessary to understand that a perfume is the addition of essences on one hand, and the composition of a creator, on the other hand.\nEssences speak especially to our collective unconscious; that is, they return us to an experience which is not personal, but linked to the ancestral connections between Man, Nature and the existential question. They touch us in the depths of our memory, and this process was brought to light by Science. That’s why it is very important to select a raw material according to its origins and its quality, because the olfactive differences are huge from one compared with another. Besides, it’s capital to favor people who harvest, as here in a tradition that is sometimes forgotten by the industrial process.\nConcerning the composition, the creator is going to orchestrate raw materials to create a recognizable, fashionable emotion. For Emilie, it is henceforth necessary to go farther and to associate the person who wears the perfume in the emotional process. It is the modern approach for which she tries to achieve by "the contextual formulation."\nTo give an example, it is rare that a person plays a tennis match in a suit and tie, or that she goes to an evening party dressed in pair of shorts and in tennis shoes. The contradiction between the image which we wish to give of us and the emotion passed on by the perfume we wear is much more spread in society. Certainly, the olfactive sense is very subtle and difficult to understand, but very powerful too since it can suggest attraction or rejection according to personal feelings and experience. A perfume can be worn for oneself or for the others, but in both cases, Emilie Bouge wanted to help the person who wears it to better understand it and to appropriate it by suggesting exactly her source of inspiration and what it evokes. To help this understanding of the fragrance, the creator worked out a software which allows her to encircle this olfactive profile according to personal considerations (color of skin, hair) and also of his or her character and state of mind (an evening with friends, a dinner between lovers…)\nThe “contextualization” answers no stereotype. Every perfume can be worn in diverse circumstances. For example, a man in a suit can perfectly wear Mauvais Garçon, and in that case it will give of him the image of a rebel personality. The whole, it is to be conscious of it.\nDesigner Brecourt has 19 perfumes in our fragrance base. Brecourt is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2010 and the newest is from 2018. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Emilie Bouge.',

			'"Starting in the late 18th century, the famed Jean-Vincent Bully, established in 1803 on rue Saint-Honoré in Paris, made a name for himself (which he then wore with a double consonant) with his perfumes and scented vinegars. Bully welcomed the advances of science and cosmetics to formulate his inventions. Among these, his perfumes and skin care products achieved lasting fame. The “Vinaigre de Bully”, a patented aromatic lotion to perform ablutions and preserve skin tone, earned a flattering reputation across Europe. This classic beauty product ensured the officine’s unprecedented notoriety for more than a hundred years.\nAfter a century of sleep, the most famous of French beauty dispensaries rises again to pursue its voyages around the world. The brand was revived in 2014. With audacity and precision, in the spirit of conquest and innovation, l’Officine Universelle Buly offers products that draw on the most innovative cosmetic techniques and on the virtues of natural ingredients. Dreamed up in Paris and formulated in a French laboratory, these products feed on the latest advances of contemporary cosmetics, all the while remaining true to the teachings of ancient recipes. L’Officine Universelle Buly revisits traditions with the freedom and efficiency afforded by all the progress achieved by contemporary laboratories: day in and day out, l’Officine passes on and pushes forward the heritage of beauty, inspired by the excellence of the past whilst offering the very best of the present. Victoire de Taillac and Ramdane Touhami are at the head of l’Officine Universelle Buly. Ramdane Touhami, an entrepreneur and l’Officine’s art director, has collaborated with Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche and Liberty , and master-minded the rebirth of the ancient Maison Cire Trudon, for which he notably created novel and now-illustrious interior “smells”. He was also the inventor of the odoriferous ritual of bell-covered candles. Under his impetus, Cire Trudon has been an international success, its products now available in 58 countries. Today, he runs l’Officine Universelle Buly, overseeing its renewal, designing its new counters and shops in Taipei, Seoul, Tokyo, London and New York, and inventing new products and rituals with a retro-futuristic feel. In addition to being a beauty traveller and adventurer, Victoire de Taillac is an expert on the history of beauty and femininity. In partnership with Ramdane Touhami, she launched Parfumerie Générale, the first alternative cosmetics store in France, and cofounded Corpus, a yearly bilingual magazine devoted to beauty of the bodily and spiritual kinds." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Buly 1803 has 12 perfumes in our fragrance encyclopedia.

She broke with tradition by using very unusual fabrics in her creations, such as wax clothing, flannelette and Lurex mesh. Her bohemian sense of style attracted numerous icons of that day and age, including Brigette Bardot. By founding her own fashion house focusing on lingerie, Chantal Thomass started a true revolution in women's undergarment. She wanted lingerie to veil and reveal women's bodies with lace and fine, transparent fabrics. Her style was characteristic, bold and daring and she wanted to support woman's sexuality and not to hide it. She offered a bit of luxury to women by offering her seductive, sensual and beautiful lingerie.\nThe first boutique of the brand was opened and the first fashion show was organized in 1976. Chantal Thomass opened her store at Galleries Lafayettes and a showroom at 100 rue du Cherche-Midi in Paris. The house specialized in lingerie and hosiery, but in the 80s they expended their offer of products to carpets, furniture and stationery. In 1998 the brand was bought in association Sara Lee/Dim. The production was expended by glasses and umbrellas, by signing special license deals. The first fragrance by the brand was launched in March 2002 and it was named after the brand – Chantal Thomass. The brand promotes by lingerie and beachwear press show in Paris and by opening new boutiques in Paris, Kiev and Moscow. In 2005 Chantal Thomass joined the Dim Brands Apparel Group and sells its textile branch. In the following year the house focused on launching nightwear, stationery, candles, pens, eyeglasses. The brand presents their lines at Maison et Objet.\nPartnerships with AGR/Createur d'Univers and JCD Creations/THG were started successfully. A new turnpoint for the company was the launch of cosmetics line in partnership with Nivea in 2009.

She rapidly gained international prominence and clientele. Later on, she settled in the Hotel Ganay in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. \n\nInitially famous for being an expert sportswear couturier, Madeleine de Rauch also developed a more classic « couture » style. Fashionable ladies particularly appreciate her beautiful tweed sets veiled with muslin and her evening gowns made of flannel or luxurious silks ». Her designs stood out for the exceptional quality of their fabrics, their cut and finish. As a friend, a partner or a rival of the Greats of her time, Madeleine de Rauch was always involved in the fashion industry. In the mid-1950’s, realizing the importance of mass production, she and eight other fashion designers established the « Ready-to-Wear Association ». Madeleine de Rauch also helped emerging talents, among them a young and promising Yves Saint Laurent for whom she found, in 1961, a workshop to start his first collection. The sixties were also the era of the “grand parade of perfumes.” The house had great success with “Belle de Rauch”, “Vacarme” and “Miss de Rauch,” with a complementary line for men, “Monsieur de Rauch”.

At the end of the 19th century Dorin entered the foreign luxury market and started exporting to the English, Russians, Spanish and Americans. Maison Dorin was the leader in opening enormous shops and important factories for production of scientifically advanced products.\nIt was in 1998 that Maison Dorin was rightfully given a new opportunity to shine thanks to Bashar and Imane Nasri.

By the end of the 1950 the shop became so widely well-known that they were tailoring custom tuxedos and gowns for Hollywood stars that visited the Cote d'Azur to attend the annual Cannes Film Festival.\nThe year of 1961means a great change for the company, because it was taken over by Goldberg's son, Albert, who renamed it Façonnable. The word comes from \"Façonner,\" meaning \"to create.\" He placed an accent on prêt-à-porter segment of production. The company grew rapidly and opened its boutique in such cities as Monte Carlo, Cannes, Saint-Tropez, Lyon, Marseilles and Paris.\nIn 1988 Façonnable expanded even overseas - to the United States thanks to an exclusive agreement with Nordstrom. Soon after that the first US boutique in New York was opened. Two new boutiques on the West Coast in Beverly Hills and in Costa Mesa followed. On top of products for men, the company also added a whole line of clothing and accessories for women.\nIn 2000 the company was sold to Nordstrom Inc., and in late 2007 to Lebanese private equity group M1 Group.

Each Velvet fragrance is inspired by a conversation, a moment, an exchange with a little girl named Fellah. Marc Antoine was struck by the innocence of this sweet little girl and her view of the world. She simultaneously represents the pureness of heart, the open-mindedness and the vitality of youth. Marc Antoine loves talking to this happy little girl who asks questions that sometimes go unanswered, her big eyes expressing her desire to discover the world, and her unadulterated\nspontaneity.\nThe creation of these fragrances therefore differed greatly from traditional processes, as Marc Antoine wanted to explain to her how the fragrances came into his mind and why she inspired them. As a frequent traveller, Marc Antoine also wanted Fellah fragrances to serve as escapism for those who wear his creations. The raw materials were chosen with the utmost care, to ensure they were more than just notes. The compositions, authentic fragrances from Grasse, all have very distinct characters and create very different moods. Fellah perfume extracts are presented in very luxurious packaging. The glass bottles, designed specifically for UGIT, display a stylish and sophisticated collar and cap. All of the shapes and colours convey softness, as well as uncluttered landscapes, the waves of the sea, and change, as if to suggest a journey. The bottles, which feel luxuriously heavy, are showcased by their packaging. Discover the\nbottle, presented on a base, by lifting the lid. Fellah will please aesthetes, those who appreciate original notes and fine French perfumery." - a note from the brand.\nFellah Paris is a new fragrance brand.

The “Estate and Trade Union” became the Bordeaux Wine Council in 1948.\nThrough its history, the house inhabited some of the most famous Châteaux: Château Citran, Château Gruaud Larose, Château Broustet, Château Ferrière, Château Haut-Bages Libéral, Château Camensac, Château Chasse Splee, Château La Gurgue and Château Gressier Grand Poujeaux.\nMaison Ginestet was taken over by the Taillan group, owned by The Merlaut family, in 1978. The Taillan group extended its portfolio of exceptional holdings by acquiring the Château Broustet estate, a 2ème Cru Classé en 1855 located in Barsac-Sauternes in 2010.\nToday, this house features about 100 employees and their work is based on the consolidation of administration and production of wines that possess Ginestet emblem, both in France and worldwide. Ginestet has developed a number of brands in accordance with different demands of consumers. These are Ginestet, Francês Roots, CAP270 by Ginestet and Marquis de Chasse.\nIn 2008, Ginestet presented the first two fragrances: Brotytis and Sauvignonne. Their scents are inspired by some of the aromas used in the wines, the primary aromas of Bordeaux wines. The fragrances are created in collaboration with the prestigious perfumery Floresence from Grace. The production began by selecting three wines by Ginestet: dry white wine, red wine and Sauternes – the wine from the franchiser Sauternais region of Bordeaux. Three types of wine were sent to an enological institute in Bordeaux to discover the primary molecules that are later used to make these fragrances.\nDesigner Ginestet has 3 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'The story of Cire Trudon brand could be traced since 1643, when "Claude Trudon becomes the owner of a shop in Rue Saint-Honoré. He starts out as a merchant of wax and spices. The candles he manufactures are used in churches and for internal lighting. During Louis XIV\'s reign, Claude Trudon sets the foundation of a company that will bring fortune to his family. The Manufacture used beeswax to make its candles. Its motto “Deo regique laborant” meant “They work for God and the King". The court of Louis the 15th and the kingdom’s largest parishes were seduced by the Manufacture’s perfectly white candles. Besides their immaculate color, they burned for a long time and didn’t splutter. In 1737, his descendant Jérôme Trudon bought the Manufacture Royale des Cires (Royal Wax Manufacturer) in Antony from Seigneur Péan de Saint-Gilles. In 1762, in the Encyclopédie Raisonnée des Sciences, Arts et des Métiers (the Encyclopaedia of Reason for Science, Art and Trade), the engineer Duhamel du Monceau published an article on the Art of Candling. His text paid homage to the Trudons’ know-how, citing the Manufacture as an example. The Manufacture supplied Versailles up to the last days of the Ancient Regime and survived through the French Revolution. No political or industrial revolutions ever blighted the Manufacture’s existence, it even survived the arrival of the “miracle of electricity”. In 1889, the Manufacture’s know-how was honored with a gold medal at France’s World’s Fair. In 2007, the company took the name “Cire Trudon” and became a specialist in manufacturing perfumed candles. Today it enlists well-known “noses” to create perfumes for the stories it wishes to tell. Each candle is still dripped and made by hand, perpetuating a luxury manufacturing which helps perpetuates the skills of its founder, Claude Trudon. In 2014 Trudon opened a store at 11 rue Saint Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie in the Marais, a historical and typically Parisian area. Today Trudon candles shine throughout the world. The brand also started personal perfume line in 2017." - a note from the brand. \n ',

In 2015, the revival of J.Lesquendieu was initiated by one of the founder’s grandsons, Jérôme Lesquendieu. Brand's approach remains true to a tradition dating back to the 1900’s, rarely found in the creation of today’s fragrances. The bottle has always been an integral part of a fragrance creation, so its fragrances are artfully paired with a fine glass bottle and cap worthy of their noble origins. Both bottle and cap are meticulously fashioned from precious hand blown glass in France by renowned glassmaker, “Waltersperger”. Each piece requires the intensive labour of 11 skilled craftsmen; a rare and extravagant endeavor, from which emerge a modest number of lavish creations for true fragrance lovers. This methodology is reminiscent of a long forgotten luxury that lies in close attention to the smallest detail to achieve excellence.\nDesigner J. Lesquendieu has 17 perfumes in our fragrance base.

He mixed musky notes, vanilla, heliotrope and rosewood which were intended to bond and build a fragrant base. But he found the scent that intriguing that he declared the composition to be finished. This perfume, which was eventually launched in 1981, is the famous Ombre Rose! Ombre Rose was unveiled at New York's prestigious department store Bergdorf Goodman and became an instant hit with New York's perfume lovers before it became a bestseller all over the world.\nOmbre Rose L'Original features notes of aldehydes, peach, Brazilian rosewood, geranium, sandalwood, orris root, vetiver, ylang-ylang, lily-of-the-valley, cedar, rose, honey, orris, tonka bean, cinnamon, musk, vanilla and heliotrope.\n1987 was the year that a follow-up on the bestseller Ombre Rose was presented. Fleurs d'Ombre Ombre Bleu, composed of carnation, orange blossom, lily-of-the-valley, honey, lily, dried fruits, hawthorn, Egyptian jasmine, amber, musk, benzoin, vanilla and cedar. This perfume was launched as a limited edition. Ombre D'Or was Jean Charles Brosseau's third fragrant creation. The composition, signed by Natalie Lorson, is based on rose, ylang-ylang and lily of the valley.\nNo fragrances were presented for more than 10 years until the year 2005 when several perfumes hit the shelves: Atlas Cedar, a complex fragrance for men with floral, woody and musky accords, was composed of clementine, rhubarb, nutmeg, jasmine, cardamom, orris, sandalwood, amber, musk and cedar. Fruit de Bois, another fragrant creation for men, features dominant notes of bergamot, grapefruit, clary sage, geranium, nutmeg, juniper, cedar, sandalwood, vetiver and amber.

It retains the “sexy allure” of the past combined with a hint of independence.\nBefore founding the house of Jean Desprez, the perfumer designed several beautiful fragrances:\nAuguste Espirte de Chine Parfum was designed in 1925, as an homage to his grandfather, the perfumer Monsieur Millot. The perfume later became the most sought-after fragrance in Paris. Esprit de Chine opens with citruses, has a spicy, creamy floral heart, and closes with a base of white musk, tree moss and sandalwood.\nJean Desprez Escarmouche is a collectors fragrance poured in a sword-shaped bottle, with a Gold tip and cap (brass), black label, and a multi colored tassel.\nJean Desprez Debutante International Edition is an exquisite perfume created exclusively for Daggett & Ramsdell.\nJean Desprez Crepe de Chine was created by Jean Desprez in 1929 and based on exclusive, high-priced jasmine. It is one of the legendary complex French scents the production of which was discontinued because jasmine became too expensive.\nJean Desprez Votre Main Perfume was released in 1930, as one of the first Perfumes accompanied with a travel case with a laminated wood exterior with a grained interior combined with satin material.\nJean Desprez Jardanel Perfume was created in 1973 as a limited edition.

Michel was the only son of the family and, as his father\'s assistant and colleague, he had a certain curiosity about this profession. This same seductive sensation and inspiration for the smells of flowers and plants as well as the space of a house near the sea did not let him think of any other work. After the death of his father, he continued this profession as the only family work. He traveled to Paris in 1939. He bought a small workshop in which he began to produce many different species that he called La Bonté to revive the name and memory of his father. In the years that followed, thanks to his connections with the royal families, the dukes and the French duchesses, he was able to make a reputation as the best producer of perfume essences.

			"Lucien Lelong (1889 – 1958) is a French fashion (haute couture) designer. His “golden age” was the era from the 1920s to the 1940s. His contemporaries were Chanel, Worth, Patou, Lanvin and Schiaparelli.\nLucien Lelong was born in Paris in 1889 and learned the bases of fashion and textile business from his father, a textile shop owner. He was later trained at the Hautes Etudes Commerciales in Paris at the age of 22 (from 1911 to 1913), and by 1914 he had already designed his first collection. In 1919, he opened his own eponymous fashion house and became extremely influential in the Parisian fashion scene regarded as a fabrics connaisseur. He was also the President of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture for many years and became one of the first designers to create a highly profitable ready-to-wear collection.\nLucien Lelong began his perfumery adventure in 1924, as he considered it to be an integral part of every woman’s style. His designs and the enigmatic traits of women served as the inspiration for the perfume creations, thus The Société des Parfums Lucien Lelong was born and it would continue to exist well after Lelong closed the door to his fashion house. His proteges, Dior and Balmain, introduced their own perfumes immediately after starting their own fashion houses, probably inspired by their teacher.\nThe first fragrances of the house were named A, B, C, J and N and were intended to evoke a sense of mystery and romance. The artfully crafted bottles were mainly designed by Lelong himself. He ended up creating 27 different fragrances in total.\nLucien Lelong closed his fashion house in 1948 when he became ill, but did not close his perfumery business which existed under his direction until his death in 1958 and long after he was gone.\nDesigner Lucien Lelong has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Take a moment and go back to the essentials for a sensorial and personal interpretation of perfume, in what promises to be a revelation.\nDuring his explorations, Thibaud Crivelli has met diverse professionals, motivated by their love of perfume and of nature in all its beauty, and he has brought them together to form a Circle. His aim is to create a spontaneous, unusual and strong rapport with all the people involved in the project, who are recognised and valued for their expertise and contribution.the origin of each fragrance lies in a very unexpected discovery of a fragrance raw material. For instance, the discovery of burnt sandalwood on the slopes of an erupting volcano, or the discovery of rose on the seaside. Thibaud Crivelli selected the most memorable experiences and translated them into modern, contrasting and surprising creations.\nFor Maison Crivelli, perfume is then the work of magicians who master both the science and rigour of composition, as well as the\nartistic creativity needed to perfectly transcribe the proposed experiences. To that end, Thibaud Crivelli chose to work with different perfumers. Each of these encounters was remarkable, leading to collaborations based on instinct and emotion. It is not simply a meeting of two minds, but also the convergence of a brand signature and a specific composition style. The Maison Crivelli Circle also brings together Guides (perfume advisors), who orient and accompany clients on a perfume revelation.

			'The story of Cire Trudon brand could be traced since 1643, when "Claude Trudon becomes the owner of a shop in Rue Saint-Honoré. He starts out as a merchant of wax and spices. The candles he manufactures are used in churches and for internal lighting. During Louis XIV\'s reign, Claude Trudon sets the foundation of a company that will bring fortune to his family. The Manufacture used beeswax to make its candles. Its motto “Deo regique laborant” meant “They work for God and the King". The court of Louis the 15th and the kingdom’s largest parishes were seduced by the Manufacture’s perfectly white candles. Besides their immaculate color, they burned for a long time and didn’t splutter. In 1737, his descendant Jérôme Trudon bought the Manufacture Royale des Cires (Royal Wax Manufacturer) in Antony from Seigneur Péan de Saint-Gilles. In 1762, in the Encyclopédie Raisonnée des Sciences, Arts et des Métiers (the Encyclopaedia of Reason for Science, Art and Trade), the engineer Duhamel du Monceau published an article on the Art of Candling. His text paid homage to the Trudons’ know-how, citing the Manufacture as an example. The Manufacture supplied Versailles up to the last days of the Ancient Regime and survived through the French Revolution. No political or industrial revolutions ever blighted the Manufacture’s existence, it even survived the arrival of the “miracle of electricity”. In 1889, the Manufacture’s know-how was honored with a gold medal at France’s World’s Fair. In 2007, the company took the name “Cire Trudon” and became a specialist in manufacturing perfumed candles. Today it enlists well-known “noses” to create perfumes for the stories it wishes to tell. Each candle is still dripped and made by hand, perpetuating a luxury manufacturing which helps perpetuates the skills of its founder, Claude Trudon. In 2014 Trudon opened a store at 11 rue Saint Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie in the Marais, a historical and typically Parisian area. Today Trudon candles shine throughout the world.

He dressed famous personalities, among them Greta Garbo, Gertrude Lawrence, Margaret Leighton and Vivien Leigh, and his designs were admired by Christian Dior and Pierre Balmain.\nDuring the times of World War 2, he moved his company headquarters to London, but eventually moved back to Paris in 1946. During this time he was working as an infantry captain for the British Forces. Molyneux retired in 1950 and left his design house in the hands of Jacques Griffe. When in 1964 he felt the urge to express his ideas through fashion designs, he founded Studio Molyneux which designed ready-to-wear collections. This company closed down in 1977 after continuous mixed reviews.\nDespite the fashion branch lying dormant, fragrances are still produced and sold under the Molyneux brand name which is now owned by Perfume Berdoues. The first fragrance, Le Parfum Connu, was presented in 1925. Back then it was called Le Numéro Cinq. Legend has it that Edward Molyneux and Coco Chanel agreed on making their own \"number 5\" each and to wait and see which one would be the more successful one. No one knows for sure if this indeed is a legend or the truth, but assuming it was the truth, it would make sense to understand why Molyneux's Le Numéro Cinq had been renamed to La Parfum Connu.\n1932 was the year that Le Chic was launched. Le Chic is a floral chypre composed of mango, peach, coconut, blackcurrant, lily of the valley, ylang-ylang, lily, jasmine, gardenia, amberwood, iris, sandalwood, cedar, vanilla and musky accords.\nThe fragrance Fete was presented 1962. It features dominant notes of caraway, plum, peach, bergamot, brazilian rosewood, lilac, orris root, jasmine, ylang-ylang, leather, sandalwood, benzoin, civet, oakmoss and vanilla. Vivre was Molyneux's fragrant offering from the year 1971. The popular floral-aldehyde composition centered around aldehydes, coriander, green leaves, bergamot, orris, orange blossom, jasmine, hiacynth, ylang-ylang, lily-of-the-valley, rose, leather, sandalwood, tonka bean, oakmoss, vetiver and myrrh.\nSeveral other fragrances, among them the legendary Quartz, Galoise and Initiation, have been launched until the mid-1990s.\nDesigner Molyneux has 21 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Before online stores became popular the clothes were sold in far more than 100 boutiques in France and in a number of international outlets. The brand became an instant hit with shoppers when their eccentric collections hit the sales floors. Princess Stephanie of Monaco was once spotted wearing a NafNaf blouse!\nNafNaf's popularity seemed to fade in the mid-1990s when other chain stores, such as Zara, H&M, Gap, Benetton and the likes, conquered the high streets. With a new business plan, store overhauls and new and more modern designs the company managed to get back to once lost glory.\nThe company now sells full collections of ladies wear, underwear, sunglasses, bags, accessories and perfumes. The first perfume that was launched under the NafNaf brand name was the oriental-floral Une Touche de NafNaf. When it was presented in 1991 it became an instant hit with girls and young women alike. The iconic fragrance has since been discontinued but remains a favorite amongst those women that were teenagers or twens when Une Touche de NafNaf hit the shelves.\nSoon after the success of Une Touche de NafNaf became apparent another fragrance was launched. Graffiti Vanilla, composed of wild strawberry, raspberry, pink grapefruit, blackcurrant, lily-of-the-valley, red peony, violet, cashmere wood, vanilla and musk, is a floral-fruity fragrance with intense gourmand notes. It was commercially successful but did not sell as well as its predecessor.\nAfter the label's rejuvenation Jean-Pierre Bethouart and Annick Menardo were asked to design a new fragrance for NafNaf. Expression, released in 2001, is a fresh, fruity, joyful and sunny fragrance built around bergamot, strawberry leaf, pineapple, freesia, violet, peony, tonka, musk, vanilla and vetiver. The charming fragrant release from 2007, the self-titled NafNaf, was composed by star perfumer Bernard Ellena. He created a fragrance with notes of mango, apple and bergamot, orchid, orris root, rose, patchouli, musk, white woods, raspberry and vanilla.\nIn 2008 the edition NafNaf Too... was released. NafNaf Too... is a fragrance with intense floral and fruity notes with a focus on the juiciness of mangoes. Fashion Instinct from 2009 is a sweet and fruity fragrance. Fairy Juice, NafNafs edition from 2011, is a floral-fruity fragrance composed of black currant, white peach, mandarin, rhubarb, white flowers , tonka beans, cedar, vanilla and musk.\nDesigner NafNaf has 10 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1991 and the newest is from 2015. NafNaf fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Jean-Pierre Bethouart, Annick Menardo, Philippe Romano, Carla Chabert, Bernard Ellena and Ilias Ermenidis.",

She developed her style through various mediums.\nDuring her youth, she was a fashion model and she appeared on the covers of prestigious magazines like Life Magazine in September 1949 and French Vogue in November 1952. She began to paint at that time, experimenting with different styles. Through her life, she lived in France, United States, Spain and Paris and was influenced by all the different types of art she came across, especially fascinated by the work of Antonio Gaudí in Barcelona and his "Park Güell", which persuaded her to create her own garden artwork later on (“Giardino dei Tarocchi”).\nHer firs art exhibition was held in 1956 in Switzerland, where she showed her naïve style paintings. Her “Shooting paintings” brought her world-wide fame in 1961, as she invented a completely new painting style using a .22 caliber rifle. After that, came the “Nanas” period, where she explored various roles of women in society through the art of sculpture.\nAt the beginning of the 80s she decided to experiment with yet another artistic media – the art of perfumery, as she accepted a challenge to bring her artistic sensibilities and unique style into a fragrance. Her eponymous fragrance was dedicated to sophisticated and bold women, like Niki herself. She considered it a statement of pure eroticism and a sensual weapon of empowering women.\nDesigner Niki de Saint Phalle has only one perfume in our fragrance encyclopedia from year 1982.',

			"House Oriza L. Legrand was, in the XIX century, the provisioner of the royal courts of France, England, Italy and Russia.\nFor example, for the Russian imperial court were created Aux Violettes du Czar (1862), Violettes du Czar pour le Mouchoir (1896, on the photo), Doubles Violettes du Czar (1900) and Parfum de l'Aigle Russe (1907).\nThe name of the perfume House is the combination of two names: Maison Oriza and L. Legrand. Maison Oriza was founded by the famous royal perfumer Jean-Louis Fargeon in 1720. The name Oriza is a game of words “or” (gold) and “riz” (rice). The last means the rice powder for wigs and makeup. Louis Legrand bought it in 1811 from the heirs of the famous perfumer along with archives of perfumes and cosmetics and opened his shop on the Rue Saint-Honore. Half a century later, in 1860, he gave it to his more young and active partner Antonin Raynaud.\nUnder the guidance of Antonin Raynaud in 1879 the company released the world's first perfume line, Parfumerie Oriza, in which each perfume were accompanied with cosmetic products with the same name and design of package. Nowadays such step it is obvious to marketers, but in 1879 Raynaud was a pioneer ahead , Houbigant, Lubin and others. The success of this line has led Reynaud to the idea to assign to the company name Oriza L. Legrand. In 1887 the company Oriza L. Legrand patented and produced the world's first solid perfume (Essence Oriza Solidifiee). Whole manufacture, from the distillation and maceration of perfume ingredients to labeling, from soap making to grinding rice for powder, was concentrated at a factory in Levallois-Perret.\nIn spring 1890, when almost in every arrondissement in Paris was perfume market, where it was possible to buy fine perfumes cheaper (Sound familiar?), company Oriza L. Legrand launches new luxury store on Place de la Madeleine, showing its course to true luxury.\nCompany Oriza L. Legrand has successfully participated in international exhibitions and has been regularly awarded with prizes and medals, from the bronze medal at the Universal Exhibition in Paris (1867) to the Grand Prix there in 1900.\nFrom the mid XIX century the company collaborates with crystal makers of Baccarat, which created not only perfume bottles for royalty, but also a few genuine masterpieces from crystal.\nFollowing the fashion trends of the time, the company has created few violet fragrances (see above), amber fragrances Fin Comme l'Ambre (1913) and L `Ambre (1920), chypre fragrance Chypre Mousse (1920) and oriental fragrances Kadidja (1920) and Venise (1925 ).\nBut let's get back in nowadays to see the reviving of Oriza L. Legrand perfumes. There are four fragrances and they have the same names as the fragrances, created in the early twentieth century: Relique D'Amour (1900), Rêve d'Ossian (1905), Oeillet Louis XV (1909) and Déjà Le Printemps (1920).\nDesigner Oriza L. Legrand has 22 perfumes in our fragrance base. Oriza L. Legrand is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1909 and the newest is from 2017.

The products are based on science, performance, pleasure that the house wants to offer each woman and achieve the ultimate goal of re-educating the skin. They retrain the skin and reactivate its various functions; they restore the skin’s natural balance and preserve its youth.\nThe house of Orlane was founded as Parfums Jean d'Albret back in 1946. It is also the year when perfumer Jean d'Albret made the company's first fragrance, called Ecusson. Since the perfume achieved a great success the brand changed its name into Orlane and turned to production of beauty care. The name ORLANE was inspired by the character of the Duchess of Guermantes - Oriane - in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Ever since then the name of ORLANE has been eponymous with elegance, grace and beauty.\nIt was in late 40es that the house created the first creams containing active ingredients. The first Institute was opened in Paris. The house started an innovative advertising policy by introducing informative advertising, illustrated with cross-section views of the skin.\nIn 1966 the new ORLANE Institute was opened in Paris The Institute did not serve just as a beauty interpreter for its clients, but also became a training center for beauticians, hosting over 100 customers a day. This is also the place where treatments, devices and techniques accompanying each new product are developed.\nAnother breakthrough product was B21 Cream which marked the 21st anniversary of the brand. It was revolutionary in that it contained amino acids and 21 active ingredients. The product was advertised by an eye-catching motto: ‘At 190 francs, it's the most expensive cream in the world, but youth has no price! B21, the cream that erases time.’ The cream later developed into a whole range of B21 products excelling in the field of anti-aging products. Therefore, is worldwide famous today ORLANE as the anti-aging specialist.\nIn the early 70es the ORLANE Production and Research centers were moved from Clichy to Orléans, where products are still designed and tested.\nSince 1985, ORLANE has been a part of a multinational, family-owned company. The brand is still growing and is particularly proud with their innovative concept: restore the skin's energy so it can carry out all of its vital functions.

During the first thirty years, the company created its fragrances, perfumes and colognes. In 1984, it changes its name to Panouge which stands for “Parfums Nouvelle Generation”, meaning “New Generation Perfumes”. Panouge asserts itself as a House of Perfume. It offers design-oriented lines such as Business Man, Unless, Eau d’Espace...\nIn 1995, Panouge took a different direction under the new management, specializing in conceptual and niche fragrances. The idea was that each line should have a story, a concept and an identity. Japanese designer Masaki Matsushima was the first designer who entrusted Panouge to develop his fragrances.\nIn 2002, Panouge acquired Isabey line and launched Gardénia as a limited edition. It was sold out in a record time and replaced by the actual Eau de Parfum line. In 2009, the launch of Bleu de Chine marked the intention to build up this prestigious line dating since 1924. Masakï-Paris conceptual brand was developed in this same period, inspired by Japanese minimalism and cutting-edge and French elegance and craft.\nIn 2009, Parisian jeweler Poiray and Panouge developed a limited edition of extract perfume with the idea of creating an olfactory jewels in mind. The portfolio is also joined by historical and celebrated brands such as Jacques Fath and Iris Gris.\nDesigner Panouge has 24 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1984 and the newest is from 2019. Panouge fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Jean Jacques, Marie Schnirer, Patrice Revillard, Francis Kurkdjian and Raphael Haury.",

His first women's wear collection was shown in 1953, and the popularity of his \"bubble dress\" design enabled him to open his first women's boutique in 1954. A men's boutique was opened in 1957, and Cardin began designing men's shirts and ties, with an eye towards a future collection.\nReady-to-wear was gaining popularity by this time, and Cardin's first women's ready-to-wear collection, for department store Printemps, was created in 1959. The first Cardin men's collection, shown in 1960, was quickly followed by a men's ready-to-wear line in 1961.\nDuring this time, Cardin traveled extensively through Japan, and was one of the first European designers to offer high fashion to the emerging Japanese market. Cardin served as an honorary professor at Japan's Bunka Fukosa design college, and a Pierre Cardin Prize for design has been awarded there since 1962. China and other Asian countries would also become important markets in the future endeavors of Pierre Cardin.\nCardin has won multiple awards for his designs, including Golden Thimble awards and the Golden Spinning Wheel. In 1971, he opened \"Espace Cardin,\" a design showroom that is also a theater, restaurant and cinema. The designer's creations expanded beyond fashion to include furniture, interior design, automobile interior design and jewelry. A series of Pierre Cardin showrooms and boutiques were opened throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\nIn 1981, Cardin purchased the famous Maxim's restaurant in Paris. He maintained the remarkable Art Nouveau style of the restaurant, adding a cabaret on the second floor and eventually turning the remaining floors of the building into a museum devoted to the Art Nouveau style. The Maxim's brand has expanded under Cardin's ownership to include restaurants around the globe, a line of gourmet foods, perfumes, and a fleet of boats.\nPierre Cardin began offering perfumes under his own brand with men's scent Pierre Cardin Pour Monsieur in 1972. Pierre Cardin fragrances are produced in conjunction with Coty.\nDesigner Pierre Cardin has 42 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1972 and the newest is from 2014. Pierre Cardin fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Raymond Chaillan, Martin Gras, Francoise Caron, Benoist Lapouza, Olivier Cresp, Dora Baghriche, Nathalie Lorson, Daniel Moliere, Christophe Raynaud, Christine Nagel and Bertrand Duchaufour.",

Their fascinatingly beautiful feathers are both light and strong, refined and sophisticated, colourful and elegant. They form works of art in their own right. Transforming these living paintings into perfumes is a different way of expressing and sharing my passion; a challenge for which I have chosen to surround myself with perfumers in order to transcribe with them the colourful intensity of their feathers, the shimmer, the iridescence which fragrances often translate to perfection.

Also one can find similar characters in other families—there are a lot of joyful persons, a lot of melancholic persons as well as creative ones. The main idea is to create the olfactive portrait inspired by the Pozzo di Borgos.\nI’ve entered the Perfume Universe with the help of my mother who raised me in the midst of scents, perfumers and samples which finally pushed me towards the profession and the idea of creating Pozzo di Borgo House.\nAt first, I decided to use my family members’ names as perfume titles but then I was afraid that people would misjudge the names. Finally, I stopped at using dates of birth instead. It not only indicates a person who inspired a scent but also helps to imagine an epoch connected to the date. If we speak about the scent that represents me—it’s the eighties, but if we have a look at the fragrance representing Carl Andrea Pozzo di Borgo we’ll see that it’s totally another era!"\nDesigner Pozzo di Borgo has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base.

After my first series «After still life » in 2011, the baroque still lives I composed with dead animals – from rats to parakeets, aquarium fish or flies – I realized that something was missing from the picture. That’s when I decided to add smells to my work. With my second series «Morbidezza » produced in 2014 – a kind of animal herbarium set against simple color backgrounds – I began my olfactory journey by diffusing smells in the air during exhibitions. I brought blends of fragrances, essential oils and scented candles to galleries, but also buckets full of manure, to immerse the spectator into an experience combining sight and smell.\nWith my latest series «Œillères », created in 2017, I was finally able to achieve my vision by calling on a “nose” to translate a photographic story into scent. Œillères - L’Objet Parfumant was born of my meeting with Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, the founder and nose of Parfum d’Empire. As a doctor of chemistry specialized in perfume plants, he has focused on different modes of extraction. His artistic approach often pushes back the boundaries of current perfumery, in intense compositions blending the carnal and the vegetal. It felt natural for me to reach out to him for my project.\nWith the Œillères series, the flowers I shot becomes an allegory of the human condition. Suspending the moment of decay, wherein that volatile yet neglected moment of decline is magnified. At a time when what surrounds me appears, smooth and lean the bodies depicted echo the flora. With shrouded faces, focus remains on the corporeal, the flesh. Œillères is a series comprised of thirty one images, and a bespoke scent, L’Objet Parfumant, accompanies the photographic series. It was created under my artistic direction by Parisian nose Marc-Antoine Corticchiato after two years of hard work, the amount of time required to achieve the desired effect: an anti-flower fragrance." - a note from the brand.\nRoberto Greco is a new fragrance brand.

She moved to Paris and opened her first boutique in the late 1920s. Her first collection of knitwear with graphic “deceive the eye” motives was presented in 1927. In 1931, she added evening wear to her fashion collection and, later on, the shop was moved from Rue de la Paix to the “Schiap Shop” in the Place Vendôme.\nShe is also famous for the use of bold colors, such as iced blue and hot pink, for her tall hat designed as a shoe, for padded shoulders on female suits. She was the first one to separate sports clothes, to use unusually shaped buttons and to use zippers and man-made fabrics. During the World War II she moved to New York and opened a store there in 1949. After the war, she came back to Paris only to find that the fashion has changed and her designs didn’t fit well with Dior’s “New Look”. She closed down her business in December 1954.\nThe most famous perfume by Elsa Schiaparelli is Shocking, launched in 1937. Its bottle was designed by Eleonore Fini and it was shaped like a woman's torso inspired by Mae West's curvy figure and draped in shocking pink that was originally made in Czechoslovakia. The fragrance was re-launched in 1998. Schiaparelli fragrances are associated with Pikenz company.\nDesigner Schiaparelli has 13 perfumes in our fragrance base. Schiaparelli is an old perfume house.

			'Established in 2016, Senyokô is a Paris- based independent fragrance brand. Senyokô demonstrates a unique fusion of French luxury and Japanese elegance by blending avant-garde elements from literature, fine arts, and music rooted in both Eastern and Western cultures. The story behind each Senyokô creation was initially told at the creators’ bedtime, and now is told by a selected niche artist. Senyokô is the ultimate form of beauty.\nThe brand’s livery comprises neutral tones of black and white, with an accent of red. This timeless combination complements the Senyokô aesthetics: refinement and restraint with an unexpected flourish. The tricolor fuses both Eastern and Western sensibilities.\n  Senyokô applies a perfectly round “shoji” window inspired by “satori no mado” (meaning “window of enlightenment”, found in Genko-an Temple, Kyoto, Japan) to the packaging of its one-of-a-kind fragrances’ outer sleeve. The sleeve serves as a "byobu" (Japanese screen), veiling the alluring inner box drawing, which is partly visible through the "shoji" window on the sleeve. The inner box drawing interacts with the illustration on the window itself. Every panoramic inner box drawing is created by Senyokô’s award-winning illustrator with an average of 160+ hours of production time. Each set of Senyokô’s unique box is hand-finished by a strictly selected manufacturer, who is specialized in small batch box crafting.\n  The brand co-crafts the cap of its fine fragrances with a leading French luxury closure manufacturer. Using a patent high-density resin, the collaboration has created a unique torn-paper texture– “the texture of life.” Every cap is carefully crafted through a complex yet special molding process in Challes, France. Each cap is slightly different from one another.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/senyokoparis/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/senyokoparis/\nDesigner Senyokô has 4 perfumes in our fragrance base.

		description:
			"Fourrures Weil, a small family-owned company of furriers, was founded in 1912. The three brothers Jacques, Marcel and Alfred Weil, who had made furs for the wealthy for years, made a natural move in offering perfumes to their clients. Parfums Weil was established in 1927. The original idea was to scent fur coats which tend to develop their own smell but this idea quickly evolved and real perfumes were available. All perfumes that were sold between 1927 and 1954 came in bottles made by Baccarat.\nDuring the war in 1940s the company closed their offices in Paris and moved to the USA. The factory in Paris is said to have been seized by the Nazis and, apparently, several perfumes were produced by them. In the end, those fragrances were not launched. After the war the factory officially went back into the Weil family's ownership.\nParfums Weil had changed ownership for several times. Since the 1960s the company has been owned by a wealthy Algerian family, Fashion Fragrances, Classic Fragrances Ltd, Cosmetiques et Parfums de France and InterParfums (Aroli).\nThe house's first fragrances, created in collaboration with perfumer Claude Frayesse, were meant to be used on fur coats to mask the fur's own natural odor. The fragrances were named Hermine, Chinchilla or Zibeline and were supposed to be used on the equivalent fur. Zibeline, for example, is a powerful fragrance with intense civet. Jasmine, sandalwood, aldehydes, honey, iris, tarragon and coriander round the composition.\nWeil have launched a number of fragrances for use on skin. Secret de Venus, a classic and feminine chypre floral perfume was presented in 1933. It features prominent notes of lavender, grapefruit, bergamot, cassia, peach, lemon, freesia, gardenia, jasmine, vanilla, cedar, patchouli and sandalwood. Antilope from 1946, a floral aldehydic perfume, was composed of notes of neroli, bergamot, aldehydes, clary sage, rose, lily of the valley, jasmine, carnation, iris, violet, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, tonka, amber, oak moss and musk.\n1971 saw the launch of Weil de Weil, a green floral perfume for women. The main accords that dominate this composition are tangerine, neroli, green notes, galbanum, hyacinth, lily of the valley, honeysuckle, ylang-ylang, mimosa, rose, daffodil, sandalwood, vetiver, civets, musk and oak moss.\nMore recent releases that have been created since the company is part of InterParfums are Weil Pour Homme, Sweet Bambou 2005, Eau de Weil and So Weil.\nDesigner Weil has 28 perfumes in our fragrance base. Weil is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1922 and the newest is from 2016. Weil fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Jean-Pierre Weil, Claude Fraysse and Jean-Pierre Mary.",

			"Charles Frederick Worth founded the couture fashion house House of Worth in the 1850s. Worth worked for Swan & Edgar, an iconic department store in the heart of London Soho that specialized in fine wool and silk items. He worked for Swan & Edgar for six years before he moved to Paris where he worked as a draper for Maison Gagelin for ten years. He had the chance to shine when he came up with ready-made and ready-to-choose muslin cloth samples and when his designs were displayed in-store. Marie Vernet, the women who modeled the clothes in store, was the woman Worth eventually married in 1851.\nWorth went on to design clothes and started the trend of sewing brand labels into the garments. He organized shows in the department store Maison Gagelin where his clothes were modeled by women. Customers attended the shows and chose the designs they liked the most so that Worth would create more garments in certain shapes, designs and colors. He moved away from the then popular bespoke tailoring to a more ready-to-wear approach to clothes. When Worth passed away in 1895 his business was taken over by his sons Gaston-Lucien and Jean-Philippe who stuck to their fathers high standards. The houses first own collection was presented in 1936.\nAs a respected couture house House of Worth was one of the first fashion brands to venture into the perfumery market. The company's first luxury fragrance, Dans La Nuit, was launched in 1924. The fragrance came in a bottle that was designed by the world-famous glass-maker René Lalique. Jacques Worth, Charles Frederick Worth's grandson, maintained the high standards that have been set and he hired the perfumer Maurice Blanchet to create four more perfumes. Those were: Vers le Jour, Sans Adieu, Je Reviens and Vers Toi.\nDans La Nuit is the legendary debut fragrance of Les Parfums Worth. Maurice Blanchet composed the fragrance of intense notes of carnation, lily of the valley, cinnamon, tonka bean, vetiver, rose, bergamot, vanilla, ylang-ylang, aldehydes and other (mainly floral and animalic) accords. Vers Le Jour, another Blanchet composition in a bottle designed by René Lalique, was presented in 1925. The composition featured mainly fruity and floral notes of bergamot, red berries, rose, angelica root, narcissus, cyclamen, jasmine, osmanthus, may rose, peony, peach, pineapple, watermelon, cedar, sandalwood and musk.\nSans Adieu, another collaboration of Blanchet and Lalique, was launched in 1929. The classic Je Reviens, composed of aldehydes, narcissus, violet, hyazinth, ylang-ylang, cloves and other floral and animalic accords was presented in 1932. The scent has been loved by many women for more than 80 years. Vers Toi, an oriental-floral composition, was launched in 1934.\nDans La Nuit was re-released in 1985 but has since been discontinued. Courtesan, from 2006, is an oriental vanilla fragrance that has so far been the most recent release of Les Parfums Worth.\nDesigner Worth has 17 perfumes in our fragrance base. Worth is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1924 and the newest is from 2017. Worth fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Honorine Blanc, Pierre Bourdon, Maurice Blanchet and Odette Breil-Radius.",

			'Bruno Banani is the successor to an underwear-brand of the GDR (Trikotex), and it\'s located in Chemnitz (formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt).\nWolfgang Jassner on the birth of the cult brand bruno banani: "The former VEB (state-owned enterprises in the GDR) Tricotex was dissolved in 1993. Only around 250 out of the 2,500 jobs before the political transformation were retained in the new companies. No future? No! I met Klaus Jungnickel, Managing Director of the then Mittelbach Textile Factory (approx. 30 employees), and told him about my idea to develop and produce a separate designer underwear collection by a commission production company. This segment was now well-established in the USA and had already achieved SUCCESS. The extension of its sphere of influence to Europe was only a question of time."\n1994 was a year of launch of bruno banani, and 1995 was a year of creating brands image. The bruno banani brand is well-known for doing things which other companies don\'t do. bruno banani destroys all clichés with a whole range of boundary experience tests which help to shape the brand\'s image. bruno banani puts this to the test with the film "Frozen Souls & Beating Hearts", which was shot in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. In the starring role, the "Your Perfect Underwear" line. In the supporting roles and also very good to look at, sexy young snowboarders. All on the steep slopes of the Rockies with a 70% incline! Back home with fantastic and surrealistic snow scenes, quickly backed by perfect music - by no less than the German duo Tab Two - and a small masterpiece is ready combining music, action and fashion.\n1996 year was known for 10,000 km through the desert. Expedition to the legendary Ophir gold-bearing region in Africa. The adventure test quickly became an extreme test for bruno banani. This is because 10,000 km of desert had to be crossed in 120 days. During the adventure test, expedition guru Achill Moser and a select team followed the centuries-old trails of gold-seekers. bruno banani supported this unique historical expedition and fitted out the team of researchers with underwear from the "Your Perfect Underwear" line. The researchers encountered sandstorms, lions, water shortages and freezing nights on their travels. These challenges can easily be mastered with bruno banani, because the expedition proved that bruno banani products stand a lot of wear. The exertions were worthwhile: bruno banani is now the first underwear line to carry the symbol "Adventure Tested."\nOn 15 May 1998, bruno banani became the world\'s first manufacturer of designer underwear to carry out the first function test in weightless conditions on board the Russian space station MIR with the "Your Dynamic Underwear" collection. The main aim of this unique fit and comfort test mission was to carry out really tough material and load tests so that the collection could be awarded the rating "Space Proofed". On 13 August 1998 it was finally time. On board the famous Soyuz rocket in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, bruno banani set off for the MIR space station. Flying time: 48 hours. Chief flight engineer Nikolai Budarin began the tests immediately. He tested the collection during his daily fitness programme in the MIR base module at 90% relative air humidity. No other results were expected: the elasticity and dynamic fit of the collection impressed him tremendously.\nIn 2000 bruno banani designed the new "Quant" watch generation, and in 2001 went to ultranautical expedition "Pressure Proof": at the bottom of the Bermuda Triangle. This was the first time that designer underwear was being taken to the bottom of the ocean for experimental purposes.\nDuring the years, among many activities, Bruno Banani made speed proof (239,697,964.948 km/h); wote and win - the first competition in space; design meets art (2005), the first underwater crash (2006), Peace Camp and Race for Success...\nDesigner Bruno Banani has 26 perfumes in our fragrance base.

She continued education at the Art Center College of Design in California, USA with a Bachelor of Science degree. Jette Joop was appointed children’s ambassador of the German Red Cross in 2003 and is involved in several projects of the German Red Cross. The German designer earned several prominent awards, such as the Duftstars award for her first fragrance, “JETTE”, or the Goldene Erbse award for her work as a children’s ambassador of the German Red Cross. She also received the Leading Ladies award “Unternehmen mit Frauenpower international” (“international companies with powerful women”).\nHer company, JETTE is very successful in creating modern and functional design, as well as luxury design affordable to masses. Jette Joop herself explained that concept by saying: “My creations are intended to bring joy to people and beautify their everyday lives, yet remain affordable at the same time. Nothing more, nothing less,”.\n“Exceptional design takes into account people's needs and sets new aesthetic standards. This often means exploring new paths – as well as paths that cross with other paths. At these intersections you meet partners with similarly high expectations in terms of design and quality. This is how crossover in design comes about in my work. It is an exchange, a mixture of different kinds of design expertise.’’\nDesigner Jette Joop has 15 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2005 and the newest is from 2018. Jette Joop fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Michel Almairac, Olivier Cresp and Julien Rasquinet.",

			"Jil Sander, born Heidemarie Jiline Sander in 1943, is a minimalist German fashion designer and the founder of the fashion house bearing her name.\nSander studied textile design and spent two years in the United States as a foreign exchange studetn before graduating with a degree in textile design in 1963. Fresh out of college, Sander worked at a German women's magazine for several years before opening her first boutique in Hamburg, at just 24 years of age. The boutique marketed fashions by such designers as Thierry Mugler and Sonia Rykiel, with a few of Jil's own designs making their way into the store. She created her first collection in 1973, and founded her own fashion house, Jil Sander GmbH, in 1978.\nSander's fashions emphasized a minimalist aesthetic and precision-cut lines that placed the focus on the luxurious fabrics of the garments. The collections consisted of separates that could be easily mixed, matched and layered. Somewhat out of step (or perhaps ahead of) the over-the-top, exaggerated fashions that dominated the 1980s, Sander nonetheless developed a cult following and fully hit her stride in the 1990s. Her company's stock went public in 1989 and allowed for the worldwide distribution of her fashions and an expansion into menswear.\nSander retired from the company in 2000, and the brand endured after a few missteps without its original designer at the helm.\nSander made a brief return to the company in 2003, but retired again in 2004. Raf Simons is the current Creative Director of Jil Sander. Ms. Sander herself partnered with Japanese label Uniqlo from 2009 to 2011.\nPerfumes were an early offering by the house of Jil Sander, with Pure Woman and Pure Man the first scents of this house, both introduced in 1979, and later reintroduced as Scent 79 Woman and Scent 79 Man. Jil Sander fragrances are produced in conjunction with Coty.\nDesigner Jil Sander has 81 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1979 and the newest is from 2020. Jil Sander fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Gilles Romey, Jacques Artarit, Thierry Wasser, Annick Menardo, Pierre Bourdon, Michel Almairac, Nathalie Lorson, Ilias Ermenidis, Mark Buxton, Evelyne Boulanger, Emilie (Bevierre) Coppermann, Jacques Cavallier, Alain Astori, Olivier Polge, Bruno Jovanovic, Christophe Raynaud, Sophie Labbe, Elise Benat, Beatrice Piquet, Sonia Constant, Olivier Pescheux, Bernard Ellena, Lucas Sieuzac, Philippe Bousseton, Domitille Michalon Bertier, Sylvie Fischer and Michel Girard.",

		title: "Puma",
		description:
			"PUMA is a German athletic shoe and apparel brand founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler. His interest in athletic footwear production began with his return from World War I. The Dassler Brothers began manufacturing shoes from their mother's laundry business. The shoes were first used in an Olympics event in 1928, and were the first athletic shoes to feature studs and spikes. Women's 800M competitor Lina Radke-Batschauer was the first athlete to win a gold medal in the shoes. In 1936, the Dassler brothers drove samples to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, where they persuaded American athlete Jesse Owens to try to the shoes. This represented, in essence, the first athletic sponsorship of an African-American athlete. Owens' four gold medals from the 1936 Olympics greatly improved the company's reputation, and athletes around the world were requesting a pair of the Dassler Brothers shoes.\nThe Dassler brothers had a falling out after World War II . Adolph and Rudolf dissolved the Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory and parted ways, each going on to form rival shoe companies. Brother Adolph founded athletic shoe company Adidas, also based in Herzogenaurach, where Rudolf Dassler registered the company name as \"Ruda\" (a hybrid of his first and last names), but the company's name was changed to Puma in 1949.\nThe original logo featured a puma leaping through the letter \"D.\" Puma shoes and apparel today feature a distinctive mark known as the \"Form stripe,\" which was introduced in 1958.\nThe company's initial focus was on football shoes, and the first football boot, \"Atom,\" was produced in 1948. The company's first boot to feature screw-in studs was 1952's \"Super Atom.\" Athletes furthered the brand's reputation by wearing Puma shoes while earning notable athletic achievements. The first post-war football goal for West Germany was wearing Puma boots. Puma's first Olympic victory came in 1952, when the men's 1500m winner, Josy Barthel of Luxembourg, sported Pumas as he crossed the finish line.\nPele wore Puma shoes in his 1962 World Cup game, early in his career. The 1970 FIFA World Cup set back a potential reconciliation between the Dassler brothers and their respective rival companies. Both had agreed not to sponsor soccer champion Pele, but Puma negotiated a secret deal that resulted in Pele wearing the shoes in the final match before millions of television viewers.\nPuma's King football boot is legendary, having been worn by many World Cup players. A special 40th anniversary edition of the Puma King, called King XL, was produced in 2008. Puma also produced shoes and apparel for Olympic runners such as Usain Bolt, and notable tennis athletes like Boris Becker and Martina Navratilova.\nRudolf Dassler passed away in 1974, and the company remained under the direction of his sons Armin and Gerd. Puma became a publicly-traded company in 1986, and in 1989, a majority share was purchased by a Swiss businessman.\nIn 2007, French luxury goods corporation PPR acquired the majority share of Puma.\nPuma Fragrances are produced in conjunction with Procter & Gamble. The fragrances for men and women often have a sporty theme and packaging and are frequently advertised or endorsed by professional athletes.\nDesigner Puma has 41 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2002 and the newest is from 2019. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Nathalie Gracia-Cetto.",

But as the company 4711 had also registered the word "Sir" as a trademark, Sir Oliver were forced to change their company name.

			'Bogner is a German brand famous for their sportswear, cosmetics and accessories.\nThe company was first started in 1932 as a small manufacturer in the center of Munich, and has maintained its quality for over 75 year. The founders were Willy sr. and Maria Bogner, and their son Willy jr. together with his wife Sônia continued the tradition and now manage the company nowadays.\nWilly Bogner senior initially started the brand with ski wear. He was a famous cross-country skier and ski jumper who won 11 German championship titles in the Nordic combination. He combined his sporting career and import of skis, accessories, and knitted goods from Norway to his home town of Munich. His wife Maria Bogner was the first to design a smartly cut winter anorak perfect for competitors on the Olympic team. She also invented stretch elastic pants presented at the first Bogner fashion show in 1948, and they were later called The Bogners.\nThe brand is available in over 30 countries worldwide and it includes collections designed by Sônia Bogner - elegant, cosmopolitan ladieswear, Bogner Woman and Man with sporty casual wear, and Bogner Sport with the Ski, Golf, Wellness, and Resort lines. The younger brands Bogner Fire + Ice and Bogner Kids are designed especially for children.\nDesign of Bogner collection actually started in 1937, when Willy Bogner senior married Maria Lux, who was from that day on responsible for designing the collection. In 1955 she invented the B accessory, the silver letter which is a symbol of the brand, that has hung from all the zippers since that time.\nIn 1972 Willy Bogner jr. joined management team running the company. He was also a successful skier, studied business and clothing technology, so he took charge over sports collection and advertising. Subsidiaries were soon founded in the US (1973) and Switzerland (1975); tennis and golf collections also entered the manufacture. In 1977 William Bogner died and his son took over managing the company. His wife Sônia became responsible for designing the ladieswear. The first licensed lines also appeared: Bogner Eyes and Bogner Parfums.\nIn 1989 the young, exciting sportswear and snowboard collection Bogner Fire + Ice ws launched. It was named after Bogner’s international sports film "Fire and Ice" . In 2000 was characterized by licenses and expansion for Bogner. License lines such as Bogner Jeans (2000), Gloves and Time (2002), Bogner Golf Korea (2002), and Bogner Ski (2004) were introduced. Some of the most important awards that the brand received were FiFi Awards for Bogner perfumes, and the silver Design Prize of the Federal Republic of Germany for Bogner Ski.\nThe first Bogner store in the US was opened in New York in 2008. Other stores were opened in Salzburg, Kitzbühel, and St. Moritz. After 2010 franchise stores were opened in Istanbul, Kiev and Yekaterinburg, and Bogner Asia was founded.\nThe exhibition "Bogner Live – Tradition + Vision" was set up in 2011 at the Apolda Avantgarde Gallery and everyone interested was able to see the history of the company from its foundation in 1932 until now!\nDesigner Bogner has 27 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1985 and the newest is from 2013. Bogner fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Dirk Lauven, Martin Gras and Evelyne Boulanger.',

Deadlines, working round the clock and travelling were taking their toll and Doris began to feel run down and exhausted, especially after the loss of her friend and mentor.\n‘I realised I had to do something to regain my equilibrium beyond simply eating healthily and going to the gym. Travelling around after Gianni´s death, I met a woman in Sri Lanka, who taught met the secrets of using natural, aromatic oils in body products and I was hooked.\nSo, I began to explore the world of complementary healing, the benefits of massage and took up yoga and meditation. I began to feel absolutely fantastic and realised the relevance of Eastern systems of wellbeing for Western consumers.’\nDoris „Dorissima“ Brugger released her first scented body oil “Aphrodite” and an all-natural beauty line in 2002, which lead to a meeting with Italian perfumer Lorenzo Villoresi. Inspired by her meeting with the master perfumer, she returned to Germany and set out to create fragrances based on pure natural ingredients: Dorissima „Goldmund“ and Dorissima „Narziß“.\nWith specific expertise in Ayurveda, issues of holistic living and inner beauty as well as being an avid practitioner of yoga herself, Doris believes these ancient and natural systems of wellbeing have much to offer in today’s fast paced, stressful society.\nDesigner Dorissima has 2 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2003.

			"Muelhens is the former parent company behind the brands 4711 and Tosca. The 4711 business was sold to Mäurer & Wirtz in 2006.\nTo tell the story of the brand 4711 one has to go back to the end of the 18th century. Johann Maria Farina composed a light and fresh fragrance that he called Eau de Cologne. The name of the fragrance was inspired by Cologne, where he resided at that point. The fragrance became a bestseller and all rights and licenses were eventually bought by Wilhelm Mülhens. Mühlhens sold rights and licenses to more than 20 individuals, a move that was judged illegal and was voided in court. Mülhens then entered into a business relationship with another individual going by the name Farina (but unrelated to the fragrance's creator) and a company bearing the name Farina was set up.\nWhen almost 80 years later a court ruled that further use of the company naame Farina was illegal, Mülhens' grandson, Ferdinand Mülhens, renamed the company. The new company name was 4711 and referred to the old house number of the business address in Cologne.\nThe full company name was Eau de Cologne & Parfümerie Fabrik Glockengasse No. 4711 gegenüber der Pferdepost von Ferd. Mülhens in Köln am Rhein until in 1990 it was renamed again. The company name from 1990 on has been Mülhens GmbH & Co. KG. In 1994 the brand was bought by the cosmetics giant Wella who went on to sell the same products under the same brand name that had been used since 1990. Procter & Gamble bought the company Wella and all its subsidiaries in 2003. In 2006 they announced the successful sales of the 4711 brand to Mäurer & Wirtz of Aachen.\nThe original 4711 Eau de Cologne was made available to the public in 1792 and went on to become an iconic fragrance. The words Eau de Cologne have become synonymous with any light and refreshing fragrance and generally lower concentrated perfumed toilet waters that people rather use to refresh their senses instead of leaving perfumed trails.\nA perfume for ladies was under the name of Tosca was launched in 1921. The fragrance was composed of aldehydes, animalic notes and floral accords. This fragrance has been many women's wardrobe staple for decades. In 1979 a fragrance called My Melody Dreams was introduced to the market. This scent aimed at young girls and teenagers and has been a past favorite of many of today's adult women.\nMäurer & Wirtz, who bought the Mülhens business from Procter & Gamble in 2006 expanded the product portfolio of the 4711 brand by several 4711 edition fragrances.\nDesigner Muelhens has 11 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1976 and the newest is from 1999.",

Fragrances regulate hormones and important messengers in the brain and thus influence physical and mental functions. Cineol, for example, has an invigorating effect because it activates not only the classic nerve cells, but also in high concentrations also the "warning nerves" trigeminal nerve. Geraniol, on the other hand, has a relaxing and powerful effect as it enhances the effect of inhibitory messengers in the brain.

Alas, the frivolous dictator Fashion and unpredictable and unjust Fortune turned their back to this Italian house – the years of great popularity were followed by the years of struggle for survival and against\noblivion.\nAt the beginning of 1990’s, three influential Italians, Diego Della Valle (Tod's s.p.a), Luca Cordero Di Montezemolo (Ferrari) and Paolo Borgomanero (La Perla), united their forces in a very patriotic impetus of preserving Italian classic – to restore Acqua di Parma.\nThey are reproducing the old fragrances, starting new projects, such as aromatherapy line Blu Mediterraneo, fragrances for interiors, leather gallantry Travel Collection… Searching for good investments and positioning at the international market, the three gentlemen signed a contract with a luxurious goods giant, LVMH, which in 2003 came to own the complete Acqua di Parma.

The sweaters sold well in the region, and Luciano invited sister Giuliana and younger brothers Gilberto and Carlo to form the Benetton Group which would oversee the company.\nBenetton opened its first store in 1966 in Belluno, but just three years later, the group had expanded to include a Paris store. Expansion in the 1970s brought Benetton's colorful clothing collection to the rest of the world.\nBenetton adopted a unique advertising strategy, beginning in the 1980s, that is as famous as their colorful fashions. Rather than advertising the company's fashions, the \"United Colors\" ad campaigns, conceived and photographed by Oliviero Toscani, featured a series of controversial images designed to call attention to a social or political cause. A man with AIDS on his deathbed, a newborn baby still covered in blood, death row inmates and the bullet-riddled pants of a soldier killed in the Bosnian war are among the most memorable. No Benetton products were included, and the subtle placement of the company's logo was the only suggestion that the photos were advertisements. Toscani retired from the Benetton campaigns in 2000, but Benetton's commitment to controversy and social activism continues into the 21st century. 2011's \"Unhate\" advertisements, featuring images of world leaders kissing, continues to generate lively discussion.\nBenetton Group today offers clothing for children and adults under the Benetton brand, as well as brands Sisley and Playlife.

The creative heads behind the first collections were a group of stylists before the young Gianni Versace created several lines in 1975 and 1976. The French designer Guy Paulin took over from Versace before Keith Varty and Alan Cleaver became the head designers of Byblos. The company quickly evolved into a fashion brand that catered for the young, the optimistic and the joyful. The ladies' wear and men's wear collections are colorful and modern, with influences from travels all over the world. Byblos was a successful fashion brand until the public fell in love with more elegant and sophisticated designs and out of love with Byblos' fun creations.\nByblos Parfums have always been a hit with their customers. The first self-titled fragrance Byblos for women is a floral-fruity composition created by Ilias Ermenidis. Byblos Uomo, an aromatic and spicy fragrance for men, was launched in 1993 after the initial success of the ladies' perfume. In 1997 several perfumes of the brand hit the shelves. Byblos Mare, a fragrance for women, was composed of mandarin orange, lilac, waterlily, violet, rose, jasmine, vetiver sandalwood and musk. Cielo, a fresh and spicy scent based on mandarin orange, coconut, pepper, nutmeg, jasmin, lily of the valley, sandalwood, patchouly and musk. Fuoco, another ladies fragrance, represents the element of fire with notes of cinnamon, spices, sandalwood, vanilla and citruses. The rich floral Terra consists of violet, citruses, galbanum, cyclamen, rose, freesia, jasmine, orris root, heliotrope, sandalwood, cedar and musk.\nThe oriental-floral Uragano and the floral-green Brezza were presented in 2000. A collection of three fragrances, Musk, Sandalo and Patchouly, was presented in 2002. The perfumes are more complex and versatile than their names suggest and were composed around notes of flowers, fruits, woods and spices.

			"Legend has it that in 1380 the father prior of the Carthusian Monastery of St. Giacomo was taken unaware by the news of the arrival in Capri of Queen Giovanna d’Angiò and so made a flower arrangement with the most beautiful flowers of the island. The water was not changed for three days and, when the flowers were thrown away, the prior noticed that the water had acquired a fragrance unknown to him. He went to the father alchemist who traced the origin of this scent back to the “Garofilum silvestre caprese”. That water became the first perfume of Capri.\nHistory, on the other hand, relates that in 1948 the prior of the Monastery discovered the old formulas of the perfumes and, with by permission from the Pope, revealed them to a chemist from Turin, who created the smallest laboratory in the world and called it “Carthusia”, i.e. Certosa.\nThe tradition is now being continued and the limited production means being able to use the same methods as the Carthusian monks. All the preparations are made from genuine products of high quality and even the end product is handwrapped. The essence derived from rosemary picked on Monte Solaro is used in men’s products, while the essence of the Capri wild carnation is used in women’s fragrances.\n  Designer Carthusia has 23 perfumes in our fragrance base. Carthusia is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1948 and the newest is from 2019.

			"Cerruti is an Italian fashion house whose roots are in the textiles industry. In 1881, brothers Stefano, Antonio and Quintino Cerruti opened Lanificio Fratelli Cerruti, a textile mill specializing in wool, in the small town of Biella. The business is passed down to Antonio's son, Silvio, but his untimely death in 1950 results in the business being run by his son, Nino Cerruti, then just 20 years old. Nino introduces modern techniques to the mill, and the results are successful enough that the operation is expanded to two additional factories.\nNino's interest moves from textiles to fashion design, and his first men's collection, titled \"Hitman,\" is introduced in 1957.\nThe brand Cerruti was officially launched in Paris in 1967, with the opening of a boutique at Place de la Madeleine. Both menswear and womenswear are created using fabrics produced at the Lanificio Fratelli Cerruti. Cerruti becomes known for its exquisite fabrics and clean cuts. Classic wool suits were a specialty of the house, and designer Giorgio Armani designed for the Hitman and Cerruti labels early in his career.\nOver the years, Cerruti expanded to offer Cerruti 1881 (the diffusion line), a luxury ready-to-wear collection named Cerruti Arte, Cerruti Jeans, the Cerruti Brothers business collection for men, and Cerruti 1881 Shapes (for the Asian market). All the clothing lines were eventually folded into the Cerruti 1881 label. Cerruti remains a preferred clothier for stars and frequently provides designs and garments for use in films.\nFragrances were an early and important part of the Cerruti brand. The company's first fragrance, Nino Cerruti for Men, introduced in 1978, is the first in a long line of classic fragrances. The first women's scent, Nino Cerruti Pour Femme, was launched in 1987.\nNino Cerruti retired from the fashion house in 2000 in order to focus on the textile business. The house continues today under the creative direction of Jesper Borjesson (menswear) and Richard Nicoll (womenswear). Cerruti fragrances are still in production today, under the Cerruti and Cerruti 1881 brands, in conjunction with Coty.\nDesigner Cerruti has 34 perfumes in our fragrance base.

He liked skiing, fencing, tennis and swimming. In the 1932 winter Olympics he was part of the Italian team. But he did not compete in any discipline. He studied in Milan, Italy and in the USA where he graduated in social sciences. The University of Florence in Italy awarded him a doctorate in political sciences.\nPucci served in the Italian Air Force as a torpedo bomber and made it to the rank of captain before he ventured into the world of fashion. The first clothes he ever designed were sportswear pieces for the Reed College's skiing team in Oregon, USA. A female friend of his wore a sportswear garment he designed for her. It was photographed when he was on leave in Switzerland. The photos taken of his creation attracted a lot of attention as the photographer who took the pictures worked for Harper's Bazaar. He designed a few garments for the magazine's wintersports edition which were admired all over the world. Instead of starting mass production of his sportswear, he set up his own haute couture house on the Isle of Capri.\nHis profound knowledge of stretchy materials helped him produce his first swimwear collection. But his love for bold colors and patterns led him to design silk scarves, blouses and dresses. His designs became popular with the high society holidaying on the Isle of Capri and he opened an outlet in Rome in order to expand his business opportunities. By the end of the 1950s his designs were worn by the most famous and beautiful actresses in the world and he expanded the brand's portfolio by another collection: Lingerie.\nThe Pucci label, famous for their easily identifiable signature prints, the so-called \"Pucci prints\", have launched many successful collections for more than half a century. The label, part of the Louis Vuitton-Moet-Hennessy Group since 2000, has retained its status as an iconic fashion favorite with celebrities and fashionistas alike.\nThe first fragrance that was launched under the Pucci label was Vivara, an intense chypre for women, in 1965.

It was founded in 1968 by Gimmo Etro, and it is still the family business.\nFragrances, colours, thoughts and Etro’s perfumes filtered into a picture book like a recipe album. A novel idea to remind us that just as the cooking of food was the first sign of civilisation, perfumes - the refined transformation of the aromatic notes that surround us - are another sublime sign of civilisation. Perhaps its most mysterious and exciting because impalpable, ephimeral, invisible.\nWhich adds even more intrigue and allure to Etro’s book as it stimulates our sight to talk about olfaction. Enticing our eyes to tickle our nostrils, using colour to spark the desire for a perfume, juxtaposing texts and images to play with our imagination. Each chapter takes its cue from the rules of colour therapy to talk about a group of fragrances no longer divided into olfactive families, but linked to the suggestive hues of a colour.\nThe certainty of white, the zest of yellow, the happiness of green, the enthusiasm of orange. And of course the passion of red, the intuition of indigo, the languour of blue, the naturalness of green. Like the alchemist’s most treasured volume, each page explores the colour syntax before telling us the story and giving us the magic formula of each of the 22 Etro fragrances. Among which we discover Pegaso, the label’s new “recipe”, a blend of lime and bergamot with a dash of neroli, a sprinkling of cedarwood, a drop or two of benzoin and rockrose and as much basil, pepper and iris as you want. Almost a poem that speaks to our soul, bringing us an echo of ancient passions but also promising us a future tinged with emotions.\nAnd looking to the future, Etro has redesigned the entire line of packaging, choosing a more modern graphic look, highlighted by paisley motifs in optical black and white shot with purple details to match the spirit of both the times and the Etro brand. An era with an insatiable hunger for feelings, sublimated by fragrances that we can now carry with us in the new smaller 50ml bottles, a special food for the senses to accompany us everywhere.\nDesigner Etro has 37 perfumes in our fragrance base.

He would remain with Dior until 1997, when he returned to exclusively designing fashions under his own name.\nThe connection between architecture and fashion design expressed itself in Ferré's designs via their rigid structures and clean lines.

He was educated at the Istituto Tessile Butti in Prato where he acquired a degree in economics and commerce from Florence University.\nHe entered the fashion business in1974 and started working with some of the most popular Italian companies such as Domitilla, Lebole and Erreuno. Graziella Ronchi hired Venturi in 1979 to design for her Erreuno collections. He was in charge of developing and establishing the soft, neutral look combined with architectural correctness which later became trademark of the company.\nHe established his own label ready-to-wear in 1979, Milan; under which he launched leather goods, accessories, men's jeans and sportswear, ladies' jeans and sportswear, activewear and lingerie lines. Venturi has also produced lines of leather garments, jeans, casual clothing, sportswear, and perfume, all marked by the label Gian Marco Venturi Made in Italy in black on a white ground. Even though the company started their business in Florence they moved in 1983 and began designing from on the prestigious Via della Spiga in Milan.\nVenturi is best known for women's ready-to-wear, which has always been stylish and expensive—sexy, sometimes suggestive, sometimes blatant or tarty. His first collection that caught a lot of attention was his autumn-winter 1989-90 collection. The line is characterized with masculine, black snakeskin jackets, black trousers and sweater, highlighted with a white shirt collar, crowned with black snakeskin gloves and dark glasses.\nThe next crucial collection was spring-summer 1993. It featured hipster chain mail belts over skirts and tabards in a red, white, and blue color palette. The look was a fun, dynamic, swingy look suggesting a star or opera diva. Venturi's menswear is usually classic and traditional, with a bit of ornamentation at times. The clothes are produced in seasonal colors of such fabrics as linens, flannels, and gabardines.\nThe most important awards Venturi received are The Oner Best Designer award, Milan, 1983; Catherine de Medici Perfume award (for best selling men's aftershave), Milan, 1986.\nDesigner GianMarco Venturi has 18 perfumes in our fragrance base.

The brand specializes in ladieswear and menswear, knitwear, handbags, accessories, glasses, ties and, since the 1980s, perfumes! Mandelli was a young woman who wanted to make her dreams come true by founding her own fashion brand. The company's name, Krizia, was inspired by Plato's Crizia who spent all his money on clothes and jewels for the pretty and obedient ladies.\nAccording to Mandelli, every woman is free to wear what she likes as long as the clothes become part of her. While Mandelli was always searching for new materials she has created stunning collections in the 1950s and the 1960s which made Krizia a reputable brand name. Mandelli still creates everything from clothes for women, men and children to silverware and kitchen furniture.\nThe company entered the world of perfumes with their first fragrant offering in 1980. The debut scent was K de Krizia, a composition based on aldehydes and strong floral notes of hyacinth, orange blossom, narcissus and oak moss. Krizia Uomo, the brand's first fragrance for men, was presented in 1983. The fragrance was created by Firmenich perfumers and centres around notes of aldehydes, musk and leather. Teatro alla Scala, the second fragrance for women, was launched in 1986 as a strong and intense floral perfume with prominent animalistic notes.\n1989 was the year of the introduction of Moods by Krizia Uomo, a men's fragrance with a core of patchouli and Moods by Krizia Donna, a lush and intense floral composition. Only two years later Krazy Krizia was presented. The oriental scent with dominant notes of flowers and vanilla is often described as smoky, dense and spicy. The classic, sweet and powdery fragrance Spazio for men is built around prominent accords of violet and musk and was launched in 1993.\nThe last perfume launch before the millennium was the woody, warm and spicy Easy Krizia which was designed by Jacques Cavallier.

Achille Maramotti, great-grandson of fashion designer Marina Rinaldi, completed law school but chose to pursue the family's heritage and dedicate himself to haute couture. His forward-thinking goal of producing high-quality but manufactured (rather than hand-tailored) women's clothing was a revolutionary idea at the time. The very first collection, a camel coat and a geranium red suit, both with clean, crisp cuts were an immediate success.\nIn the 1960s, Max Mara continued to develop its production techniques while expanding its range of products. Collaborations with notable designers of the day, such as Luciano Soprani, Karl Lagerfeld and Jean-Charles de Castelbajac helped enhance the brand's reputation and value. The company's philosophy is to emphasize the brand, rather than the contributions of an individual designer.\nThe company transferred to London in the late 1960s, to take advantage of the creative energy of the time. The London collection was named Sportmax, geared towards the individualistic youth market.\nCoats have long been a staple in the Max Mara lines, and the 1980s saw the introduction of their classic \"101801\" wool coat. Blended of finest wool and cashmere, double-breasted and with kimono sleeves, the coat is a symbol of the house and has since appeared in every winter Max Mara collection with no changes in its design. The iconic coat has been immortalized by artists and photographers in numerous works.\nAchille Maramotti passed away in 2005, but the company remains in family hands, with sons Luigi and Ignazio, and daughter Ludovica having followed him into the family business.\nMax Mara today offers clothing under 35 different labels, including the Max Mara, Sportmax and Max Mara Occhiali lines, as well as a line named in honor of the family's fashion matriarch, Marina Rinaldi. The company has more than 2,000 stores in over 90 countries, and has expanded its offering to include accessories, bridal wear and perfume.\nMax Mara fragrances are offered in conjunction with Selective Beauty.

Armed with a strong work ethic and some skills, Celestino gathered his few possessions and left with his new wife Luisa to seek opportunities in Rome. As it happens, Celestino was one of many who made the journey—part of a generation of young men from Sant'Elena who plied their trade on bicycles and scooters before sacrifice and hard work enabled them to open shops and manifest their talents. The knife-grinding wheel that could hone razors and scissors was soon accompanied by shaving soaps, hair lotions and colognes. Years pass and the names of the young men from Sant'Elena now embellish the most beautiful streets of Rome. The knife grinders from Sant’Elena are now among the most important perfume makers of the Eternal City.\nCelestino and Luisa are now grandparents who left Giuseppe, Luciano, Maria and Felice Durante the possibility of forging their own path and achieving what they believe in. However, commerce evolved, together with the perfumery market, and globalization and standardization encumbered them. The Durante siblings were no longer at ease in such a context. They felt manipulated and no longer free in their own work, prompting them to seek a new direction.\nIn 1996 they created “PRO-FUMUM ROMA.\" To hold a Profumum Roma fragrance in your hands is to hold a fragment of this story. If you visit Sant’Elena, and walk past the big bronze statue resembling a knife grinder, they encourage you to please stop for a while, for there lays their roots.\nWith perfumes that commemorate every aspect of the magnificent city of Rome, the message of Profumum Roma is about transmitting emotions and sensations, through the scents that are our memory.\nDesigner Profumum Roma has 37 perfumes in our fragrance base.

However, the comapny's biggest successes were realized after Dante's grandson Nicola took over the company in 1965.\nNicola's age and business sense regarding the social changes of the 1960s helped propel this company to international fame as a fashion house and luxury lifestyle goods brand. One of the most important changes made by Nicola was the adaptation of a distinct logo—the Trussardi Greyhound— which would adorn its products and give the brand a unique identifier in the marketplace.\nUnder Nicola's direction, Trussardi expanded from gloves to luggage, handbags, home and office accessories, and leather jackets that were up-to-the minute in trendiness. The company maintaine dits commitment to fine Italian craftsmanship, and its reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality items spread around the world. Trussardi's first boutique in Milan was opened in 1976 and remains the company's flagship store. Trussardi goods were exported to the United States and all major markets in Europe.\nThe house of Trussardi expanded into fashion in the 1980s, offering menswear and a women's line. They staged their fashion shows at in theatrical halls and were among the first designers to make their shows open to the public. Under Nicola's leadership, Trussardi Group launched the lines Trussardi Jeans, Trussardi Home, Trussardi Baby, Trussardi Junior, Trussardi Eyewear and Trussardi Perfumes. Trussardi was one of several Italian companies who worked to improve the distinction of the \"Made in Italy\" label. The 1990s saw the expansion of Trussardi into the Asian market.\nNicola Trussardi's untimely death in 1999 from a car accident has not slowed the success of the company. Trussardi remains a family business under the leadership of Beatrice Trussardi, the fourth generation of the family to hold the reins. Under Beatrice's direction, the company expanded to include brands Trussardi 1911, Tru Trussardi and TJ.\nSince 2005, Trussardi offers fragrances in conjunction with Selective Beauty.

Theirs, is a family of merchants that once proudly owned and ran the most antique perfumery in Amatrice. Then, came the first tremor. Followed immediately by indescribable fear. Dust and debris became their most vivid recollection.\nThere are not enough pages to account for what happened in the days that followed. Some of you know about it, some of you were there, others from a distance are still involved today in extraordinary projects of solidarity and there are those who are still simply trying to understand.\nFirst, they lived in tents, then a container was assigned to them some weeks later as their new home. The Serafini family decides that waiting in the hopes of the resumption of their work makes them ill at ease, especially since there is very little left of their town to make them feel the slightest bit comfortable.\nMarina and Roberto begin to speak with a few friends, then confide in still more friends about their deepest fears. Finely, it is thanks to Vincenza Bufacchi of the National Confederation of Artisans and small to medium business enterprises of Rieti that they were able to meet Silvana Angeletti and Daniele Ruzza. \nThis couple, both highly respected designers, immediately seized the moment: Marina and Roberto should develop an entirely new and positive business model starting from the source of the one passion that they have always shared together and loved the most – the world of perfume. A perfume.\nThe idea was to create a perfume that would bear the name of Amatrice, one that would signal new  beginnings by combining quality sensorial characteristics with action as opposed to just waiting.\nAt this point, it was necessary to place our trust in a nose for the creation of this new and exclusive fragrance:  Lorenzo Dante Ferro, Master Perfumer didn’t hesitate to undertake the project and straight from the beginning in September of 2017, he began to work on the alchemy of the essences as suggested to him by his own intuition.\nThis is how 401 È Amatrice came into being.\n401 È Amatrice is a new fragrance brand.

The land in and around Treviso was mainly used for agricultural purposes then, but has developed into a province with mainly industrial and business activities. The original focus of the company was the manufacturing of premium brushes and accessories from fine materials from the Orient. The quality of their brushes was well-known and Acca Kappa was made the official brush supplier to the British Royal Family. By the end of 2011 Acca Kappa has been Italy’s favourite and most successful manufacturer of brushes.\nSince the very beginning the company has stayed in the family's ownership for most of the time. When the company was disseized from the German merchant during the First World War, Krull, who had six sons by that time, bought it back from the Italian government. When Krull passed away in 1936, the family bought the company back one more time.\nDuring the second half of the last century, the company not only stabilized their business-to-customer relationships, but ventured into new business sectors. Acca Kappa now sell different products like soaps, hand cream, shaving foams and accessories, hair and skin care products and perfumes. Natural materials like honey, yeast, wheat germ and other plant extracts are used wherever possible. The use of natural ingredients and the manufacture and use of machines especially designed for Acca Kappa helped the company produce premium good of the highest quality. This is return has resulted in Acca Kappa being recognized as an upmarket brand that is trusted by all their customers.\n1997 was the year that saw the presentation of the company's first perfume. White Moss, an aromatic fragrance with fresh, spicy and musky notes, was launched as a unisex scent. The fresh composition of Cedro for men was launched in 1999. The first fragrance for women only was the white flower perfume Calycanthus which hit the shelves in 2003. 2004 saw the release of a range of perfumes for women. Glicine, a floral fragrance, was composed of wisteria, sandalwood and other floral, fruity and woody notes. Hibiscus, another floral scent, features notes of hibiscus, magnolia, amber, heliotrope and bergamot.

		description:
			"Acqua di Biella is an Italian niche brand, established in 1871. in Biella.\nHere is the story of the Acqua di Biella brand:\nIn 1865 Luigi Cantono goes to Germany to study chemistry and here he has also the opportunity of learning the ‘secrets’ of the production of what is known as Eau de Cologne. Once back in Biella, he decides to tool up his factories for the production of perfumes and body-care products.\nIn 1871 in the historical building in XX Settembre street in Biella, production begins of a fragrant cologne that he calls Acqua di Biella. In the “Perfumery Inventory: Raw, processed and manufactured materials” of Luigi Cantono’s company, dating back to January 1 st 1872, in addition to colognes there are also mentioned bear fat, castor oil, “flowers of Italy” and violet ointments and also analgesic paste, toothpastes, brilliantines, soaps, rose juice lip creams, face-powders, scented candles, etc.\nIn 1878 the Reale Manifattura Luigi Cantono is granted the Savoia coat of arms as official supplier of the Savoia Royal Household.\nIn 1880 Acqua di Biella starts to become well-known and appreciated all over the world. It is awarded prizes and medals, among them a first class gold medal at the international perfumery exhibition held in Melbourne, Australia in 1880, a gold medal in Milan in 1881, an Diploma of Honour in Biella in 1882 and a gold medal at the Turin exhibition of 1884.\nIn 1900 the Reale Manifattura Luigi Cantono is enlarged and introduces new manufacturing activities. The more modern and better equipped perfumery laboratories of the new Manifattura carry on unchanged the production of the Acqua di Biella line, following the original recipes, which are handed down with fond devotion. From generation to generation Acqua di Biella production remains strictly handcrafted based on careful processing, top quality raw materials and highly selective distribution.\nIn 1965 Luigi Cantono’s wife, Paola Corradi Cervi, descendant of an aristocratic family of Parma, introduces into the Acqua di Biella line new and sophisticated fragrances with a French flavour and also refreshes the brand’s image, giving it a refined and elegant new style.\nIn 1980 Consuelo Cantono, the sensitive and talented “nose” of Acqua di Biella, recognising the importance of expanding the Acqua di Biella line introduces new fragrances taken from the old recipe book of the Reale Manifattura, and which share the same qualitative values.\nIn 1996 Chiara Cantono, fourth generation, joins the company. A rebel with an independent streak just like her great-grandfather Luigi, she had left Biella in 1978 and moved to the more cosmopolitan Milan.\nThere she obtained a degree in architecture, developed a fifteen-year expertise in product planning and communication and started a promising office in Milan. In 1996 she feels the time has come to honour her family tradition, by making use of her professional experience to revitalize the legend of Acqua di Biella. Taking up the challenge, Chiara Cantono wishes to build on her great-grandfather’s experience creating, with the help of great essence producers, a new line of peerless fragrances. An olfactory trail through the memories and experiences her family and those of the Biella area, that are the inspiration for all the fragrances.\nIn the Cantonos’ story there is one person who left an important mark. Alfonso Sella, a good friend of Chiara’s father and husband of her paternal aunt, Ada Cantono. A great botanist and scholar of Biella’s customs and dialects, he personifies the harmony between erudite culture and popular knowledge, between the love of art and a passionate interest in nature. In the numerous texts that he wrote he was able to restore life and literary vigour to the vanished popular traditions of his land. Chiara and Consuelo dedicate the dialectal names of the new Acqua di Biella fragrances, Baraja, Janca and Bursh to this extraordinary uncle.\nIn 1999 the whole Acqua di Biella production network, distribution system and product image are reorganised, staking everything on the quality, selectivity and internationalisation of the brand. The production is focused on alcoholic perfume. After selecting the best and most reliable suppliers and the highest quality raw materials, the production is entrusted to skilled craftsmen capable of ensuring compliance with the standards of quality of the house, keeping the entire production within the Piedmont territory. With the fabulous cologne called N° 1 starts the creation of a line of extraordinary fragrances that share the quest for quality and excellence, as well as the experience of a family, and of Piedmont, the territory full of history and ancient traditions to which it belongs.\nThe new silver packaging, with its precious chisel, that accompanies all the fragrances, is a tribute to the crystal-clear and wildly turbulent rivers of the Biella area. It gives a feeling of freshness and indomitable strength, together with a refined elegance.\nThe square bottle and black urea resin cap bearing the Acqua di Biella seal recapture the precision and simplicity of the original packaging. The label carries the coat of arms and the awards conferred on the “Reale Manifattura Luigi Cantono”.\nIn 2003 Acqua di Biella, with its brand-new image, is offered again in Italy and abroad through a strictly selected network of specialized and niche shops.\nSee The Art of Italian Perfumery in Acqua di Biella Fragrances\nDesigner Acqua di Biella has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Born in Florence April 13, 1519 from Lorenzo de Medici e Maddalena de La Tour d’Auvergne.\nI was named Caterina and I was immediately orphaned because both my parents died the same year I was born. Starting from an early age I came into contact with the world of perfumes, thanks to the monks and alchemists of our court that crafted wonderful distilled essences from herbs. At that time in Italy, the use of fragrances was a normal and indispensable practice for ladies and nobility as a means to show their prestigious social standing. We can therefore conclude that fragrances were always part of my life.\nIt was when in 1533, in the game of political alliances between states, that my family sent me to wed the Duke of Orleans, the next King of France. I could not help but bring with me my world, the things that I was most emotionally fond of, in order to feel less distant from my beloved Florence.\nI thus asked that the best chefs, pastry cooks, ice cream makers (how I liked to eat well), musicians, astrologers, artists (living in a city like Florence, I was always interested in all forms of art) and especially my personal perfumer Renato Bianco, accompany me. Thereafter, Renato Bianco followed me for my entire lifetime, marking it with unforgettable fragrance inventions.\nSo I left with my entourage of damsel, page boys, knights and escorts to Marseille, then the seat of the Duke. For me it was a real trauma. Accustomed to the refinements and fragrant essences that always enveloped me; I had to cross a fetid city, full of filthy and smelly people curious to see me from close up; who eagerly approached me, surrounding me with rancid and putrid odors. At the time lack of hygiene and caution towards using water was normal even for the highest nobility why take a bath, especially in winter, in cold and not very well heated rooms, even though luxurious, it could often translate into pneumonia and death.\nArs Mirabile is a new fragrance brand.

			"Borghese is an Italian cosmetic company. It was founded in 1958 by Princess Marcella Borghese, a member of the noble Italian family Borghese.\nBorn Marcella Fazi, she married Prince Paolo Borghese, the Duke of Bomarzo in 1942. Many aristocratic Italian families commissioned their own cosmetics and skin creams and so did Borghese. Their secret recipes were made using fruits and other natural ingredients. Marcella decided to create a small range of lipsticks based on these formulas. In those days, only two lipstick colors were available – one was for brunettes and the other one was for blondes. Marcella wanted to make more shades of lipstick so that they matched various hair colors and clothes. She wanted to name them after her favorite jewels. The family opposed the idea at first, until Pope Pius XII gave it his blessing.\nIn 1956 she met with the founder of Revlon, Charles Revson, who helped her establish and create her own cosmetic line. One of her first collections was a collection of bright-colored lipsticks and nail polish, inspired by her friend Pucci’s collection of knitwear. She was one of the first ones to create cosmetics based on the natural therapies of a spa. She named it “Montecatini” after her personal favorite spa. The princess was involved in her business up until her death in 2002.\nRevlon sold the cosmetics to a group of Saudi investors in 1991, together with Halston fragrances. It was renamed Halston-Borghese, and it was owned by that investment group until 2000 when it was sold to American Georgette Mosbacher, who had success with the La Prairie brand in the early 1990s. She renamed the line again simply Borghese. Georgette Mosbacher is the current CEO of the company.\nToday, Borghese cosmetics combine the Italian tradition and modern innovations resulting in high quality of skin care, color and treatment products that celebrate the beauty of women.\nIl Baco Eau de Parfum is the houses’ famous fragrance, presented in 1993 and still produced.\nDesigner Borghese has 3 perfumes in our fragrance base.

It was founded by Ettore Bugatti (1881 – 1947), an Italian born automobile designer and engineer who lived and worked in France.\nEttore Arco Isidoro Bugatti, after finishing school and shortly attending Academy of Art, became an apprentice at the bicycle and tricycle manufacturing plant Prinetti & Stucchi at the age of seventeen. He built his first engine-driven tricycle there, followed by his first automobile, financed by Gulinelli brothers, in 1900. This car won an award at an internationally renowned industry fair in Milan. From 1900 to 1904, he worked as technical director of De Dietrich’s automobile manufacturing plant and developed new car models. After that, he got the job at Emi Mathias where he designed a new automobile and installed a 4-cylinder engine. He stayed there for two years.\nEttore Bugatti was very passionate about designing race cars. In 1906 he developed an automobile with a 50 hp engine and sold it to Deutz Company. He was named the leader of the production department in Cologne.\nEttore Bugatti founded his own automobile company in 1909 in Molsheim, in the French region Alsace which belonged to Germany in that period. In 1910 five cars were built and all of them were sold. Bugatti's assistant Ernest Fredrich drove Bugatti cars in races. Bugatti’s models became appreciated as quality race cars. The first Monaco Grand Prix in 1929 was won by William Grover-Williams who was driving a Bugatti car. Between the years of the First World War, Bugatti designed and produced aircraft engines for both the American and French governments. In 1921, Bugatti's race car team took first, second, third and fourth place in Brescia at the Voiturettes Grand Prix and these wins immortalized the Bugatti Model 13. Bugatti’s dream to build the most luxurious car ever made came true in 1926 with the development of Royale model. Only three Royles were sold due to the Great Depression.\nThe years of the Great Depression brought financial problems to the company, but Bugatti managed to get the contract to build a new high speed train for the French government. The only car model that was still being produced at this critical period at the beginning of the 1930's was the Model 57.\nAlthough only about 7,900 automobiles were built while Ettore Bugatti was in charge of the company, many of these vehicles have survived to this day. The founder died in 1945, and after that the company struggled financially, releasing only one more car in the 50s. Italian company Romano Artioli was the first one to revive the brand in 1991. It launched the EB110 in time for Ettore Bugatti's 110th birthday. Only about 150 cars were produced, and the company closed again in 1995.\nThe second revival of the brand was due to the German Volkswagen company, which bought the Bugatti name and reopened the factory in Molsheim. In 2005, the company presented the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, luxurious, well designed and fast.\nBugatti fragrances are made in cooperation with the Jacques Bogart Group.\nDesigner Bugatti has 3 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1999 and the newest is from 2006.",

			"COMO LAKE is a brand-new fragrance collection inspired by the countless meaningful facets of the Italian lake. Created by Celso Fadelli with his talented and creative team, the brand expresses three decades of experience in the field of Art Perfumery. \u001eThe collection draws inspiration from Lake Como, renowned body of water carved inside the Prealps mountains. Lake Como is the deepest lake in Italy, with a maximum depth of 418 meters and a perimeter of 170km. With its characteristic reverse Y-shape, its beautiful and timeless landscape has inspired poets and musicians throughout history, including Alessandro Manzoni, Stendhal, George Gordon Byron, and Franz Liszt.\n\nLake Como is known for its colour and its multitude of shades, which vary at different altitudes and according to the surrounding vegetation. Th\u001ee Prealps’ reflection on the water creates unexpected and mesmerising colours, ranging from light blue to green, grey, and the deepest shades of Cobalt. Over the past ten years, tourism in Lake Como has grown exponentially, attracting celebrities and cultured visitors from all over the world. Each COMO LAKE fragrance was created with a story behind it, conveying profound meanings. Its modern and contemporary packaging was designed to express a sophisticated and creative touch that resonates with Art Perfumery.\n\nEach detail of the project is connected to the lake’s unique characteristics. \u001ee blue-green shades on the glass bottle resemble the multi-coloured shades of the water, darker at the bottom to recall the depths of the lake, then increasingly clear towards the top. Th\u001ee linear carvings on the cap evoke ripples on the water, while Lake Como’s distinctive shape decorates the top of the cap, in gold.\n\nOne could say that the notes of any given fragrance compose an olfactory harmony, just like notes on a music sheet create a melodic masterpiece. Like an oneiric journey accompanied by melodious notes on a piano, therefore, every COMO LAKE fragrance presents an olfactory chord that reflects the lake’s countless mesmerising aspects. Aligned with this inspiration, the name of each fragrance is a subtle reference to renowned musical melodies: Bacio nella Pioggia (Melody of Tears), Notturno (Nocturne), Note d’Amore (Love Theme), Un’Altra estate (Rhythm of Another Summer) and Silenzio (Silence).\nThe fragrances were created by Celso Fadelli in collaboration with his perfumers team at Intertrade Europe.\nComo Lake is a new fragrance brand.

His father Tommaso Caraceni from Ortona a Mare taught his craft to Domenico and his brothers Galliano and Augusto. The shop from 1913 was closed two years after due to the war. Domenico Caraceni opened his main shop in 1926 at Via Boncompagni 21 in Rome and later in Milan, Naples and Paris. The Paris atelier was operated by Domenico's brother, Augusto.\nDomenico combined the English tailoring, which he learned from Francesco Paolo Tosti, with the Italian and many other tailoring techniques. Domenico was convinced that he invented a new style, combinig all these other styles, making his suits elegant and light at the same time. He wrote his own book in 1933 named “Orientamenti nuovi nella tecnica e nell’arte del sarto” (“New Tendencies in the Technique and Art of Tailoring”).\nThere are several separate tailoring bussines under the name of Caraceni today. The original shop in Rome operates with a very small workforce and it is owned by Tommy and Giulio Caraceni, nephews of Domenico. In Milan, there are three branches of the brand but A. Caraceni, operated by the son of Augusto Mario Caraceni, is believed to be best. Gianni Campagna who was formerly an apprentice at Sartoria Domenico Caraceni in Milan, bought the Sartoria Domenico Caraceni brandin 1998. Under this name, his company makes expensive tailor-made suits out of the Palazzo Bernasconi in Milan.\nDesigner Domenico Caraceni has 3 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2007.",

My love of perfumes has made me start a collection, of which I am very proud.\nThat evening though I was going to attend a memorable party on the lake, and I didn’t have my “Wanderer”. The party, the location, the music, it was all wonderful, but even though I was wearing the perfect dress, I felt naked. Walking across one of the main halls, I reached the garden of the Villa, which in that period was blooming, the colours and smells of the flowers blended together in a perfect symphony.\nThere I realized that in my suitcase there was an entire wardrobe of dresses, but for that particular occasion I was completely naked. Yes of course, in the car I had two perfumes, but they weren’t the right ones, I didn’t have with me the perfume that wraps you in a cloud of happiness and confidence, the perfume that dresses your emotions. How I would like to have opened my luggage to find my entire collection of perfumes there and be able to choose one of them as one does when getting dressed in front of the mirror.\nDuring the journey back home I thought about how I could avoid that feeling of discomfort, petty and irrelevant for some people, but of some relevance for someone who loves perfumes like me.\nThis is how E-suitcase came about, a personal suitcase to dress my emotions while travelling, something to have constantly with me, a suitcase for someone like me, who gives space to scented emotions before anything else." - Marianna Zeni\nDesigner e-Suitcase has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base. e-Suitcase is a new fragrance brand.

At the heart of this reality are feelings, the sharing of emotions, the memory of memory, the dream of experiences yet to be lived. \nThe choice of the name focuses on the indisputable and entirely personal sense of the family. To each of us, our sense of belonging, our roots , our network of affections, to each his own personal emotional identity and his own emotions that are tickled by the proposed olfactory suggestions. The perfume, universally recognized as the highest means of stimulating memory, thus becomes an indispensable ally for telling memories or for stimulating new emotions linked to a fun afternoon out of town, a beautiful awakening in clean sheets, an important life-changing signature, a garden on which to lie down and read a book.\nFamilia Familia speaks with a contemporary language and breaks down any reference to gender or role by creating unisex fragrances and dedicating some of these to children, further emphasizing the idea of sharing. To each his own family declination, his own network of affections and affinity. For everyone, the chance to evoke them through perfume and to have the same fragrance of Familia-Familia that brings them closer to memory in sharing.\nNo forced story, no limits for the creation of one\'s own suggestions. The names of the fragrances represent titles for personal stories, pages to remember and blank sheets still to be written with their own personal life story.\nFamilia-Familia starts from memory, evokes the memory of the past but lives the ever-changing present like the olfactory pyramid made from a background base -  the origins  - the heart notes -  the memories  - top notes like  moving emotions.\nThe mark: Familia Familia deliberately repeated and arranged as if one were the reflection of the other on a body of water.

His designs are colorful, carefully tailored and feature unusual luxury materials such as platinum threads, precious stone adornments and thousands of tiny gold balls.\nMattiolo has dressed celebrities from Cher to Diana Ross to Pink. Mattiolo had the high honor of creating four copes (ecclesiastical robes) for Pope John Paul II in 1996. In 2000, Mattiolo coined a neologism to describe his new designs: prêt-à-couture, which is the synthesis between the luxury of high fashion and the handicraft industry.\nFragrances have been part of the Gai Mattiolo offering since 1997, when his signature scent for women was launched. Gai Mattiolo fragrances are currently produced in conjunction with ITF Cosmetics.\nDesigner Gai Mattiolo has 15 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1997 and the newest is from 2009. Gai Mattiolo fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Jean Claude Delville, Maurice Roucel, Alberto Morillas, Mark Buxton, Bernard Ellena, Alain Astori, Beatrice Piquet and IFF.",

As a matter of fact, the “ghost nose” represents the perfumer himself, whose ability is only smelt but never seen. A stylized bottle with a twofold interpretation is the symbol of this collection: a perfum container which fades into a nose shape, just an optical illusion confirming the subtle nature of the one who gives life to the fragrance. He is an artist whose experience can indeed be listed among the essences within the perfum he has created. The pillars of the Ghost Nose philosophy have been erected by the contact, both human and professional, between the young brand manager and this selection of experienced “noses”: a refined style that meets the needs of a fresh and young public, bringing the niche perfumery to those who want to discover a whole world of quality essences." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Ghost Nose Parfums has 9 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Gianluca Bulega got his degree in June 1994 at the “Istituto Europeo di Design” in Milan with a thesis written with the collaboration of Roberto Capucci.\nHis stylistic/artistic vocation was confirmed by the excellent reviews of the famous art critic Bonito Oliva on his Tricolour Dresses exposed at the Museo d’Arte Contemporanea in Bologna in 1997.\nBulega’s creativity often anticipates current trends, e.g. the design of jeans-couture dress exposed in 1994 at the Fashion Biennal in Barcelona: the idea of jeans-couture has been only recently resumed by a lot of international fashion stylists.\nFrom Alta Moda Roma catwalks, Gianluca Bulega launched a lot of new inputs, like the dresses inspired by Andersen’s tales (January ’97), Lady D. (January ’98) and Erté (January ’99). His art inspirations, which played with that modest nudities that made conformists sigh at that time, were later massively resumed -with less modesty- in fashion parades all over the world.\nAfterward he got a lot of other appreciations for his creations inspired by art: e.g. his memorable fashion parade, inspired by Toulouse-Lautrec paintings, which took place in the wonderful ancient rooms of Palazzo Marchi in Parma.\nHis many stylistic collaborations (e.g. with Soul To Soul, with Creola Couture in Dubai; with Baratta as artistic manager; with Hemmonds for Burberry’s London E1 line) made him famous in the international environment for his characteristic ability to absorb, interpret and recreate, in a dress or in theatrical costume, the spirit and temper of the past, present and future time.\nDesigner Gianluca Bulega Couture has 6 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			"Isabella Fiorella Elettra Giovanna Rossellini, born in 1952, is an Italian actress, model and author. She is the daughter of Ingrid Bergman, one of the most loved and famous actresses of all times.\nAt the young age of 19, she left Italy and moved to New York. During her college years she has been working as a translator and a presenter for the Italian TV channel RAI. Isabella's model career took off when, at the age of 28, she was photographed by Bruce Weber for the British edition of Vogue. During her model career she has worked with many reputable photographers and her pictures appeared in countless magazines. It was her successful model career that secured her a deal with Lancome: She became the worldwide face of the brand and has represented Lancome for 14 years. Rossellini modeled for Madonna's controversial book Sex and starred in the music video to the singer's hit Erotica in 1992. She has also been working in the movies sector since 1976. She has been cast for a number of roles since her part in the American movie White Nights. Some of her most notable performances can be watched in the movies Fearless, Cousins and Blue Velvet, the latter one winning her an independent award.\nRossellini is a notable author, too. She has published three books, one of them is the fictional memoir Some Of Me from 1997. Her charity work and activism are well-known. She is a board member of the Wildlife Conservation Network and serves as the president and director of the Howard Gilman Foundation. She is a national ambassador to the UNICEF US Fund and helps training guide dogs for blind people.\nIn 1995 she was signed to Coty and had the chance to develop her own skin care brand. Her line was given the name Isabella Rossellini Manifesto. A fragrance with the same name was launched in 2000. Manifesto, the perfume, was composed by Alberto Morillas. Morillas used powerful notes, such as basil, pepper, bergamot, lily and rose, to create a women's fragrance with floral and green accords. La Bella, the second fragrance under the brand label of Isabella Rossellini, hit the shelves in 2002. This women's perfume is a much-loved floral and oriental composition built around the sweetness of heliotrope, tonka bean and iris and the fragrant power of tobacco and oak moss.\n2003 saw the release of the women's perfume My Manifesto. It features spicy, fresh and green notes that center around basil, bergamot and pepper. The famous French perfumer Natalie Lorson developed another fragrance for women for Rossellini in 2004. The name of this scent is Daring. The name fits the perfume as it is often described as sexy, feminine and inviting. Rossellini's most recent fragrance launch was the presentation of Storia in 2006. Storia is a floral composition built around creamy, sweet and musky accords.\nDesigner Isabella Rossellini has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2000 and the newest is from 2006. Isabella Rossellini fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Nathalie Lorson, Richard Herpin and Alberto Morillas.",

			"L'Amande is an Italian cosmetics brand. \"In the nineteenth century L'Amande was one of the main brands of the ancient Marseilles soap making \"Garcin & Rabattu\". The growing importance that the brand gradually assumed and the great appreciation on the part of the clientele meant that in 1884 it was registered at the Chamber of Commerce of Marseille and even gave its name to the company: thus was born the \"Huilerie & Savonnerie de L'Amande\" , destined to become one of the most important soap factories of the golden age of Marseille soap making (late 19th century, early 20th century).\nDuring the important expansion phase of the 1950s L'Amande crossed the Alps, becoming an Italian in all respects, along with other minor brands of the FISAM (Italian Factory of the Savonnerie Amande of Marseille) of Vallecrosia in the province of Imperia, a company set up around 30 years earlier from the Huilerie & Savonnerie of L'Amande specifically to produce and market their soaps in Italy and Colonies. Meanwhile in Marseille, also due to the heavy losses caused by the bombings of the Second World War, the Huilerie & Savonnerie de L'Amande ceased its activity. All of its original formulations, machinery and customers finally passed to the company L'Amande Srl based in Savona.\nThis history, our history, so ancient and so rooted in the territory, that strip of land bathed by the Mediterranean Sea between Genoa and Marseille is now part of ourselves and our products. For this reason we use only the best oils, perfumes and essences of our land, with specific olfactory and phytocosmetic virtues: olive oil, real Mediterranean gold and sweet almond oil from which our brand took its name; the broom, the strawberry tree, the typical blackberry plants of the Mediterranean maquis; the honeysuckle and the hawthorn that perfume the country lanes adorning the typical dry stone walls; the pitosforo now an integral part of the landscape of the Riviera and many others.\nPerfumes and sensations of a land where the sea breeze blends with the warm, sometimes flowery notes, sometimes more decidedly fruity than a generous Nature in every season, where plants, aromatic herbs and flowers invade paths, hills and even cliffs.\" - a note from the brand.\nDesigner L'Amande has 17 perfumes in our fragrance encyclopedia.

			'Pino Lancetti is an Italian fashion designer from the Perugian town of Gualdo Tadino. From the 1950es till 2001, when he retired from fashion, he was one of the main haute couture designers in Italy.\nHe was studying at the art institute in the city of Perugia and planned to make ceramics his business. During his studies, he became interested in clothes. He opened a small atelier in Rome, sold freelance sketches to fashion salons and designed for the house of Carosa.\nSince Italian fashion houses producing high fashion – alta mode, started opening salons in Rome, Lancetti did the same in 1961. One of his first collections was displayed in the Pitti palace in Florence. In the years to come the designer joined Fabiani, Capucci, Mila Schon and Valentino in the Rome shows. Since alta moda disintegrated in the 1970s, he discontinued his regular fashion shows.\nLancetti drew inspiration for his fabrics and designs from paintings of major artists such as Kandinsky, Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse. He visited galleries continuously, which influenced his cut and construction. His other sources of inspiration were oriental and folk decoration, and the movies.\nLancetti became head of a handicraft company and was very popular among wealthy ladies who appreciated the luxury and fine quality of his clothes. Some of his clients were Princess Soraya, Queen Paola of Belgium, Salima Aga Khan, actresses Silvana Mangano and Monica Vitti, who highly appreciated his unique beaded dresses.\nIn 1963 the designer turned to production of clothes appropriate for daily occasions. He had a successful collection based on military details and leather, but never produced ordinary clothes such as jeans, because he strongly believed that women are to be elegant. One of his best collections were the clothing items dedicated to Picasso presented at the French Academy at Villa Medici in 1986.\nLancetti restructured his company in the 1990s, since it was very difficult to find experienced and skillful craftwork for his meticulous designs. He made licensing deals and started new labels for cashmere knits, bridal dresses etc. With a desire to modernise the Lancetti image, several new labels have been created: "Miss Francesca" and "Lancetti & Company." Men’s clothing and accessories also entered the offer.\nThe most important award the designer acquired was the Alta Moda award in 2000, which crown his most beautiful and elegant collection. The ‘new’ company continued functioning with great achievements, while Lancetti was dedicated to painting.\nDesigner Lancetti has 23 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1985 and the newest is from 2012. Lancetti fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Mark Buxton and Arturetto Landi.',

			"Lotto Sport Italia is a worldwide famous Italian sports apparel manufacturer and designer, offering its products in more than 60 countries.\nLotto was founded in 1973 by the Caberlotto family in Montebelluna, northern Italy, the world centre of footwear manufacturing. The company launched its first football-related products in the same year. Additionally, footwear for tennis, basketball, volleyball, athletics and football were launched in the years to come.\nSoon after that, they concentrated on sports clothing. Primary concern of Lotto was Italian market and then its spread its offer worldwide. The company’s strategy focused on making tennis footwear and clothing, and early on sponsored big names from the professional tennis circuit (Martina Navratilova, Boris Becker, Thomas Muster, Andrea Gaudenzi). As these players became more famous, Lott attracted more attention on their products – on the courts of Wimbledon, the US Open and Roland Garros.\nIn the 80es Lotto went international by designing its first football boot models and signing major collaboration agreements with internationally renowned players and teams. Tennis players John Newcombe, Andrés Gómez and José Luis Clerc wore the brand's tennis products.\nThe first sponsorship agreements in football were signed with players (Dino Zoff and Ruud Gullit) and teams, such as AC Milan (1993–98), the Netherlands national football team, Napoli, Juventus, Chievo Verona, and Real Zaragoza). Professional athletes helped in product design and in presentation of the company’s image. During this same period, Lotto expanded into the export market, and its international business grew rapidly.\nLate 90es meant a great change for Lotto – since it was taken over by a group of local business people who were already very active in the sports area. The company was renamed Lotto Sport Italia, and its new owners focused on the brand’s strengths of dynamism, innovation, quality, Italian design, passion and an extremely effective customer service program.\nLotto’s products can be found in independent sports stores, specialty chain stores and large stores with sports departments. The company is pushing the development of corner and flagship stores.\nSince 2005 Lotto has launched 10 sporty fragrances for men and women. Lotto’s latest collection, which includes four Lotto Elements fragrances, was introduced in March 2011 and achieved a lot of success. The new collection is inspired by the elements of earth, fire, air and water and offers their strength and energy transformed into four fragrances. These four fragrances provide four kinds of active energy—pure energies based on emotion, power, endurance and strength.\nLotto Air is a spicy woody fragrance opening with sparkling lemon. The heart is composed of ginger, cardamom and sage, while the base notes are cedar and sandalwood, accompanied by oakmoss. Lotto Water offers an aromatic aquatic composition, refreshing with top notes of thyme. The heart of the composition develops with ivy, geranium and cumin, while the base consists of patchouli, cedar and white musk.\nLotto Fire is woody and spicy scent with expressed accords of amber. Bergamot is at the top, cinnamon, bay leaves and cardamom are in the heart, while sandalwood, tonka and amber remain in a warm trail. Lotto Earth is an aromatic spicy fragrance opening with bergamot. The heart provides a wonderful harmony of petit grain, lavender and violet, while the base notes include Bourbon vanilla, amber and cedar.\nDesigner Lotto has 10 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Her style is primarily influenced by her years in Italian region of Reggio Emilia where she attended schools since fifth grade.\nMariella designs for delicate yet strong woman - a woman on the move, a woman who laughs and cries, a woman who dresses like a woman but has an androgynous streak. Her imaginary picture of woman consists of Reggio girls who dressed in grays and subtle hues and the women of Cavriago used to work on the fields. These women were not perfect, but it is their imperfection that gave them special appeal.\nIn late 1960s and early 1970s, her collections of children's clothes attracted a lot of attention and became very popular. In her designs she tried to present children's innocence and in a certain way she stayed true to her childhood dream to work with children. In 1975 she was appointed head of fashion design of the Burani Company. Among many awards Mariella received during her career in fashion, the most important ones are the Italian Republic Knight Prize and the Best Costume Design Prize of Hollywood.

Since then, she became popular outside the boarders of Italy, winning the Neiman Marcus “Fashion Oscar” prize for color.\nHer most famous fashion invention is the double faced fabric, dynamic and precious. Considered to be visionary but also pragmatic, Mila Schön regarded her fashion as lifestyle and remained very successful through 80s and 90s. She died in 2008. Her idea of beauty was explained like this: ““I notice only the ugly part of things. By eliminating it, only what is beautiful remains”.\nJapanese group Itochu bought the brand in 1992.

			"\"Milano Cento was originally launched in 1989 by my husband, Dean Tatum, and his late business partner, Matthew Bright. After running their own interior design business they decided to create their own brand, and over a period of time came up with 'Milano Cento'. Initially intended as a clothing range, the brand evolved over time into the fragrance it's now known for.\nThe Milano Cento fragrance was inspired by the classic sophistication of all things Italian, and aimed at those who wanted something that bit different. Following consultations with their perfumer and substantial market research this aromatic men's fragrance was born.\nAfter an extensive marketing campaign Milano Cento quickly became a success nationwide, available in stores such as Selfridges, Fenwick, Harrods and John Lewis, along with a number of independents.\n25 years on, with the odd bit of original Milano Cento memorabilia still around the house, our son Jasper and I decided to get a single bottle recreated as a 50th gift for my husband. I soon found it was slightly more complicated than just approaching the original perfumer and creating a single unit. This sparked us to explore products, and led to the idea of bringing back Milano Cento.\nA little market research later, and we had discovered it is still a desirable fragrance. We soon found ourselves looking at bottles and caps, and looking into other products to compliment the range. Trying to find someone who could produce for us, in the quantities we were after was certainly a challenge. Our few bottles had now grown to quite a few and it became clear that what we thought would be a bit of fun on the side was going to require more than just a few snatched hours!\nWith the last of our 4 children now at school, it felt like the right time for a new challenge! I resigned from my job as a Montessori teacher, and with a lot of family input, we have set about modernising the bottle, packaging and advertisement. Jasper has recreated the logo and produced all the packaging and advertisements; we now have a stockroom full of Fragrance!\nRather than entering the market in a dramatic way, as was done in the original launch, we are looking for organic growth through specialised stockists, which we, as a small company, can support in a personal way.\nOur initial range included a 50ml Edt, 100ml Edt and a 150ml body wash, which we offer as a gift with purchase to new customers, and have since added an alcohol free Deodorant Stick. Having begun selling in June/July 2016, we now have 70 stockists dotted around the country. Our aim is to grow a solid brand that will still be around in years to come, our challenge is letting everyone know we are back!\"  - Valissa Tatum\nMilano Cento is a new fragrance brand.

The genesis of the project lasted 7 years, until the creation of Smell Zero Zero srl and the foundation of the brand in August 2017.\nTo all the infinite possible definitions of the perfume, we have only added our language, simplicity. The entire Mine Perfume Lab collection smells simply like what is indicated on the label.

Every single perfume is made and packaged by hand, one at a time.\nThe Mine Perfume Lab fragrance range comes\nwith three intentions:\n- To complete the olfactory pyramid, giving the consumer the opportunity to choose their own fragrance.\n- To bring the concept of perfume back to the essential, presenting simple and classic traditional fragrances, offered with a taste of the contemporary.\n- To mix fragrances with natural ingredients by hand, without industrial processes. Without parabens, without preservatives, without glycerine or dyes.\nAll products have a high concentration of essence and are “Vegan” as they do not contain animal derivatives and are not tested on animals.

"NEBBIA (FOG) is a new series of three fragrances dedicated to this interesting phenomenon that since ever has fascinated, moved and welcomed me. Those who know my photography will completely understand this encounter which took place in absolute coherence, along the fine line of life and limit. I walk, leaving behind me the last houses and the last lights, I go deep into the forest. I walk along an unknown road and the edges start to mix up and blend. I take a never seen direction and everything starts to wave, the contours are shaded, the noises are cosy but above all, it is me who is waving and fading. Together with the need of finding a path I need to find into it the meaning of the life, of the things of being alive.\nNEBBIA is the lack of references and measures that exponentially stimulate every sense, everywhere, whether alone or with a friend. We and the trees are now the inhabitants of this natural setting, where every fence gets shot down. All of a sudden the things are braided, the trimmings are confused, doubts arise, what before seemed clear and far away, now becomes smoky; the space expands and gets smaller, the chronology blows up; what was usual is now strange, what was familiar becomes extraneous and disturbing; something never seen before suddenly arises and take an unexpected form; beyond the borders of confidence the uncertainty appears; the well-known is now undistinguished and from it any new form could start; the object becomes obscure and the subject just takes wild shots in the dark, with unsteady footsteps, like in a labyrinth.\nWe start to question not just what is in front of us, but also of yourself; not just the world, but also the self is distressed by an extended disorientation; everything seems to be suspended and held, about to disappear and being sucked in, the feeling of loss and confusion, there is nothing we can do. The deformation of things and their dissimulation creates thin anguishes. The mystery is the key and leaves a strange taste in mouth.\nNEBBIA is clothing for boundaries, for erased borders, for uncertain steps. It fades away the differences in the ages of life, it eclipses the thoughts and make us lose the solemnity of the common point of view. While spreading out in the wood, NEBBIA induce to stay hidden, to disguise.

			"Logic will get you from A to Z, imagination will get you everywhere. The first range of perfumes was born from the desire to be proud of being Italian, because our country has been the genesis of some of the most brilliant and creative minds of all humanity. A journey begins with words, sounds, colours and aromas, which unite in a rainbow of suggestions, a bridge between heaven and earth: like on the strings of a multi-coloured harp. They tremble in unison in a timeless space on the tightrope of perfume to finally reach the heart, the home to our innermost emotions. A journey in search of long lost meaning, and for this we came across exalted poets, minds which are multifaceted in their genius, painters and sculptors, musicians and mystics.\nCharacters who have given life to works of great genius and beauty, like Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Dante. Great musicians, like Puccini, who with their music have thrilled and continue to thrill entire generations. People like Francesco D’Assisi, who completed perhaps the greatest of all works: revealing the beauty of the Creation to the world through his good deeds. It is exactly because we believe in the genius and in the unquestionable Italian talent, in a sort of new desirable Renaissance, that we wanted them as interpreters of our fragrances, of the great Italian perfumers, like Luca Maffei and Maurizio Cerizza.\nOnly those who know and recognise the quality of raw materials can recall the evocative power of the sensory codes inherent in them, translating fragrances into emotions to be worn and lived. Where do we enclose our scented emotions? How do we seal the light of aromatic pulsations of our magical perfumes? With a bottle that communicates the love and respect for nature and that expresses a message of eternity for our Earth? From a dream come visions of ancient stone arches.\nLightly resting on white clouds, silhouetted against the blue sky. The stone in the centre that supports the entire arch is the “Keystone”. The stone is of the earth and in it history is carved. The stone is Eternity, it is immortality. The fastening of the bottles in marble, an essential artistic element of Italian architecture since ancient times, reveals the natural choice. The marble design recalls the aroma with its swirls and waves.\n“So why a stone cap then? Because it represents the infinite part of a bigger rock called the Earth, which travels towards Infinity.

Libeccio, Grecale, Schirocco and Maestrale, this spring, bring to us new aromas. Libeccio is mild northwestern wind that is named by the Mediterranean sailor and it cuddles us with aromas of Libya. The combination of violet, jasmine, rose, and lilac, in top notes, magnifies experience of spring, with eucalyptus and mint that give rhythm of freshness. In the heart of the perfume, we meet violet’s root, chords of juicy white peach, and raspberry. Grecale is fresh northeastern wind that brings, in top notes, the scents of fresh sweet orange and citrus with lily of the valley, flowers of geranium, and hyacinth.

The perfumes carry Italian names and are poured inside colourful flacons made of finest Venetian glass, coloured by hand and decorated with gems and 24 carat gold. Colours of flacons refer to names of the fragrances: Fuoco (fire) has a red flacon, Aria (air) is transparent, Acqua (water) hides in a blue flacon, while Terra (earth) is coloured in green.\nThe first fragrance of the collection, Fuoco, is as passionate and temperamental as its fiery red flacon. Its opening is very fresh and fruity, made of bergamot, lime, apple, pineapple, lavender and plum. A floral heart composed of pink pepper, rose, cardamom, rosemary, clary sage, violet and geranium is resting on a sweet, woody base of patchouli, sandalwood, honey, vanilla, vetiver, amber, cedar and musk. Transparent glass of Aria hides a clear, energizing and gentle fragrance. Its top notes are sweet and floral, introduced by pineapple, bergamot, apple, plum, lime and milk. An opulent, exotic heart is blossoming with jasmine, rose, freesia, gardenia leaves and lily of the valley. A base is filled with amber, vanilla, tonka, white musk, sandalwood, patchouli and cedar.

For more than two decades, Ugolini has refined his craft to the point where his shoes are revered by people from Singapore to New York.\nEntering the Ugolini workshop is like entering wonderland, one scented by the fine Florentine leather test shoes lined up in rows, exuding a sense of rarified luxury, fine waxes and balms, and exquisite taste. Long a passionate collector of unusual and artistic fragrances himself – perhaps owing to the sensory luxuriousness that links fine leather and perfume – Roberto Ugolini was encouraged by a long-time customer, the German perfume connoisseur and craftsmanship enthusiast Herbert Stricker, to make the leap from fragrance enthusiast and collector to creative director of his own line of fine fragrances.\nDrawing on Stricker’s long experience as a retail distributor of fragrance, together they worked on a carefully edited line of fragrances that reflect the history and artisanship of Florentine craftspeople. In this spirit, the leather label of each bottle is punched by hand and carefully placed on the bottles, and the caps are made of fine ram’s horn (available as matte or polished).\nRoberto Ugolini's perfumes are timeless, unique and tasteful. Wearing one of them is like choosing to wear a hand-made leather shoe or a bag made by the hands of a Florentine craftsman, each detail reflective of long hours of loving labour and respect for history and tradition.

Sergio inventiveness and craftsmanship now shine through Simone, one of his grandchildren, who, after working for the family beauty products business, has today created four unique fragrances inspired by the stunningly beautiful cars designed by his grandfather at the celebrated Scaglietti Carrozzeria. The ‘Racing Line’ range takes inspiration from the elements that have characterized Sergio's world famous car production. The harmonious curves and smooth edges, that he so loved, are replicated in the simple and elegant silhouette of the perfume bottle sealed by a steel cap which recalls wheel bolts. The outer packaging features a reusable and recyclable aluminium tin, using the same material that the Carrozzeria would have utilised to create new and exciting prototypes, whilst its shape is inspired by the pots of paint supplied with every Scaglietti model, as the colour of each car was tailor-made. Sergio was also one of the first car designers to employ laser serigraphy, a technology that Simone has now chosen to use for the engravings on his refined packaging.\n ‘Tradition and Innovation’ this was Sergio's motto.\nDare with new shapes, but never lose sense of what you are doing, where you are coming from and what you wish to create. This is the concept which transpires from the simple and innovative packaging; effectively elegant yet firmly focusing our attention on the true nature of Simone’s project and passion: his fragrances.

			"Ferruccio Lamborghini founded Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963. The wealth he accumulated by his successful management of several other companies allowed him to make his personal interest in cars a professional one. Lamborghini loved Ferraris but did not find them refined enough. To his ears they were too noisy. Therefore he intended to make road cars that offer luxurious designs and powerful engines, but would be more refined and comfortable.\nThe Lamborghini 350GTV was designed and manufactured within only a few months and was presented at the Turin Motor Show in 1963. The car's design was completely reworked and only a year later a completely different 350GTV was presented at a car fair in Geneva. The legendary Miura was presented in 1967. The Espada, Lamborghini's first car that sold more than 1,000 models, was manufactured for the first time in 1969. The beginning of the 1970s was a difficult time for the car manufacturer. A worldwide financial crisis meant a loss in profits and a slow-down of production for all the companies that Ferruccio Lamborghini owned. He eventually sold 51% of Automobili to a wealthy financier from Switzerland. But this deal bought little time only. The oil crisis of 1973 caused several manufacturers of high-performing and gas-guzzling cars a large drop in sales and Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the remaining 49% of his stake in the company in 1974. Despite the brand's most famous model, the Countach, going into production, a financial disaster could not be avoided. By the end of the 1970 the company filed for bankruptcy. Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran took control of Automobili's finance and operation department, reworked the failed model Silhouette, and restructured the company bit by bit.\nIn 1987 Lamborghini Automobili was sold to Chrysler and in 1991 the company joined the motorsport circuit - a step that Ferruccio Lamborghini never wanted to make. 1990 was the year that saw the introduction of the Lamborghini Diablo, the then fastest car in the world. Lamborghini changed ownership for several times before the super car Murciélago was presented in 2001. The model was a financial success until the recession in the end of the 2000s bit. The model was discontinued and replaced with the new Aventador.\nLamborghini ventured into the world of fragrances in 1999. The perfume collection consists of mainly masculine scents with only 2 fragrances, Lamborghini Pour Femme and Overall, aiming at women.\nDesigner Tonino Lamborghini has 16 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1979 and the newest is from 2018. Tonino Lamborghini fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Anne Flipo, Beatrice Piquet, Alienor Massenet, Vincent Schaller, Guillaume Flavigny and Jean-Charles Niel.",

A history of delicate flowers picked in the early morning, of precious fragrances that were extracted in copper alembics and of their voyage from Sicily to the French maisons de parfum, where talented perfumers would transform them into unique scents. A history which is also a family history that goes more than 50 years back in time, when an artisanal fragrances distillery was settled in Via dei Mille, in the baroque town of Noto, and which is renewed today with the discovery of Sicilian finest raw materials, the encounter with the art of Grasse perfumers, and the design of this first exquisite scent collection which reminds thousands of stories, memories and sensations of a mythical and enchanting Sicily. VIADEIMILLE · SICILIA is first of all the result of a family history, but it is also a story of renaissance, of friendship, of search and discoveries, of regard for deep roots and ideas.\nThe aesthetic universe of VIADEIMILLE reinterprets in a new and original way these copious and unique cultural influences regarding the place where the story of our project has originally started: the baroque town of Noto, today a World Heritage Site together with the late baroque towns of the Val di Noto, in South-Eastern Sicily. Such as our fragrances, the visual language of VIADEIMILLE definitely revamps the tradition. Distant from stereotypes, it is in the details which are often disregarded, in the minor decorative elements such as the embroideries of the ornamental friezes, the elegance of ancient tile patterns, the stone laces, the forms of the wrought-iron balconies that we have been searching our source of inspiration in order to design an evocative but original brand universe. During our creative process, a variety of styles first overlapped, but then dissolved, finally reappearing in the refined form of a contemporary "minimalist baroque." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner VIADEIMILLE SICILIA has 4 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'Issey Miyake is a Japanese fashion designer known for his innovations with fabric and his use of technology to produce interesting and practical garments.\nMiyake was born in Hiroshima in 1938, and was a witness and survivor of the atomic bombing of the city during World War II. After studying graphic design at Tama Art University in Tokyo, Mikyake went on to work for some of the most famous couturiers of the 1960s. A move to Paris led to work for Guy Laroche and Givenchy. Another move to New York brought the opportunity to design ready-to-wear for Geoffrey Beene. Miyake returned to Tokyo in 1970, founded the Miyake Design Studio and began producing women\'s fashions.\nMiyake\'s extensive knowledge of fabrics led to an innovation in garment pleating that uses a heat press to add permanent pleats to garments that were already cut and sewn. Other innovative fashions from Miyake include A-POC (acronym for "a piece of clothing") which are tubes of fabric that can be cut into a variety of shapes and styles by the purchaser, and the me Issey Miyake line (also known as "Cauliflower" outside the Asian market), a line of one-size-fits-all shirts that stretch to fit the wearer and are sold in plastic tubes.\nMiyake officially retired from design in 1997 but continues to oversee all the lines in the company.\nMiyake\'s fashions and perfumes reflect a sense of humor and make use of multi-lingual puns. A-POC, for example, sounds like the English word "Epoch." When Miyake launched his first perfume, L\'eau d\'Issey for women in 1992, the name is a homonym for the French word l\'Odyssée ("odyssey" in English). A Scent by Issey Miyake, launched in 2009, could be read as "ascent by Issey Miyake." Miyake also maintains a store in Japan called ELLTOB TEP ("pet bottle" spelled backwards) which sells his entire line.\nIssey Miyake fragrances are offered in conjunction with Beauté Prestige International, a division of Shiseido.\nDesigner Issey Miyake has 96 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1992 and the newest is from 2020.

			'Japanese corporation FITS has introduced a collection of fragrances "Love Passport", inspired with pure and unconditional love. The aim was to connect the fragrances with the theme of love. Love Passport Parfums have offered many kinds of love in stories which follow each of the fragrances and each of the bottles of this collection.\nInspirations for creation of these fragrances were the characters by Raymond Peynet, one of the famous world\'s illustrators on the topic of love. Raymond Peynet was born in 1908 in Paris, where he completed the school of arts and worked as a draftsman in a commercial agency Tolmer.\nIn 1930 he married Denise Damour and in order to make more money he was sending his drawings to some of then renowned Parisian newspapers le Rire, Rire à deux, Paris Magazine, The Boulevardier...until in 1942 his life was suddenly changed.\nThat year he drew "Les Amoureux"-The Lovers, two simple figures whose faces enchanted and won hearts of people around the world. That drawing brought him a great success that thanks to it, and subsequently other 6000 illustrations on \'The Lovers\' theme, he became one of the most famous French illustrators.\nSince their appearance, The Lovers have been transformed into figures, painted on scarves, on books, medals and pendants, made of porcelain… and put on things that symbolize love.\nThe Love Passport fragrances are the continuation of the romantic story of The Lovers. They were created by renowned perfumer Henri Bergia and are devoted to young women who value uniqueness and identity, creativity and passion for life. Each of the fragrances is a love story for itself which brings primordial happiness, romance, style and unconditional love.\nDesigner Love Passport has 19 perfumes in our fragrance base. Love Passport is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2008 and the newest is from 2011.',

			"Shisseido is a Japanese cosmetics and hair-care company founded in 1872. Although the company is Japanese, its name is derived from a passage in the classic Chinese text I Ching. A translation of the name reads, \"Praise the virtues of the great Earth, which nurtures new life and brings forth new values.\"\nArinobu Fukuhara, a former Head Pharmacist for the Japanese Navy, founded Apothecary Shiseido in 1872. After a visit to the United States, he added a soda fountain to the pharmacy. This was the beginning of the \"East meets West\" concept which would serve the future cosmetics giant so well.\nArinobu's son Shinzo was the Shiseido company's first president. Shinzo studied Eastern medicine at a Japanese university, then traveled to America to study pharmacology at Columbia. A world traveler and a camera buff, he traveled to Paris in 1915, where he first encountered photography as an art, according to the Western aesthetic. Shinzo would go on to become a celebrated photographer, and his unique background, incorporating both Eastern and Western traditions, helped move Shiseido from its origins as an apothecary to the cosmetics corporation it has become today.\nShiseido was the first company to develop a softening lotion in the liquid form with which we are familiar today. Shiseido also introduced the concept of color cosmetics to Japan with its seven colors of face powder, which revolutionized the industry at a time when white face powder was the norm in Japan. By 1923, the original shop had expanded to multiple outlets, and it became a publicly-held stock company in 1927.\nThe company's original expansion began in Taiwan and Singapore in 1957. It crossed the pond to Hawaii in 1962, which provided entrance into the American market and led to the formation of Shiseido Cosmetics America. European expansion began in 1968, followed by New Zealand opening up Oceania in 1971.\nToday, Shiseido offers products under approximately 18 different brands throughout the world. Among them are the Shiseido skin care line, NARS cosmetics, Joico hair care products, and perfumes produced under the Shiseido label, through division Beaute Prestige International and under the Serge Lutens label.\nZen was the first fragrance offered by Shiseido. The company produces it today in two formulas: the original Zen, featuring the packaging from 1965 and a similar formula, and a new version of Zen introduced in 2007. A men's Zen was introduced in 2009. Shiseido's former employee, Serge Lutens, a make-up artist and designer for the company, introduced classics Nombre Noir and Feminite du Bois under the Shiseido names. Serge Lutens is now an independent line producing fragrances under the Shiseido umbrella. Shiseido's Beaute Prestige International division produces fragrances for a number of prominent designers such as Issey Miyake, Jean Paul Gaultier and Narciso Rodriguez.\nDesigner Shiseido has 69 perfumes in our fragrance base.

As Japanese, we desire limitless stimulation and excitement, as we rapidly absorb and amplify trends from around the world, lining the sky with skyscrapers, with everything operating in coordinated regulation. On the other hand, we also have traditional aesthetic sensibilities such as “Zen”, “Fuzei” and “Wabi-sabi” speaking within us-mental virtues providing stability to the heart that are a fundamental part of our DNA. For those of us living in these modern times, the general view is that “appeal” should be easy to understand and represented logically, but our ancestors had a culture of valuing the beauty that appears when appeal is purposefully hidden inside. “Hidden beauty” brings creativity to knowledge and stimulates new thoughts. This is a creative and avant-garde beauty-different from appeal that, like a gaudy, flickering light, speaks to our primal nature.” – Tobali Founder Muneki Hashimoto\nThis “hidden beauty” has been visualized by Tobali Creative Designer Tomoyuki Yonezu from EROTYKA TOKYO PARIS. A creator active on the front-lines of both the field of fashion and high fashion, his style is influenced by the arts unique to Japan. His inspiration comes from the white vessels used to store offerings to the gods, white Japanese paper used to wrap the bottles for sacred wine, Mino ware pottery that is respected artistically around the world, and even Japanese candles, burning with a unique flame. He reconstructs traditional Japanese culture using a modern reinterpretation, realizing hidden beauty with just a pure white melody." - a note from the brand.\nTobali is a new fragrance brand.

The company created a new name using M (from Moustache) plus E (from (Emanuelle) plus XX (an abbreviation for "kiss kiss" ).\nThe success of the Mexx brand allowed for expansion into children\'s clothing (Mexx Kids in 1990, Mexx Mini for toddlers in 1992 and Baby Mexx in 1997).

		title: "Viktor&Rolf",
		description:
			'Viktor & Rolf is an Amsterdam-based fashion house. The "Viktor & Rolf" of the house\'s name are Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren. Both Viktor and Rolf were born in 1969, and met when they studied fashion at the Academy of the Arts at Arnhem. The pair bear a slight physical resemblance to each other and are known for being photographed or strutting down the catwalk after the fashion shows in identical outfits.\nSuch spectacles are also present in their fashion shows, which take the form of artistic presentations and which have featured such interesting sights as a single model being dressed in nine different layers of couture gowns, fashion shows that featured models wearing blue clothing that served as a "blue screen" for film projections, and shows in which each model wore her own scaffolding with her own lights and music. For their first menswear collection, "Monsieur," Viktor and Rolf modeled the clothing themselves, changing outfits onstage in front of the press and guests.\nThe pair are known for their creativity and artistry of their clothing collections. To no one\'s surprise, the pair have also had their fashions and designs featured in exhibitions at some of the world\'s most renowned art museums. Viktor and Rolf have also published a series of books and have designed costumes for theatrical productions.\nPerfumes seem like a natural extension of this creative pair. The first Viktor & Rolf fragrance, Flowerbomb, was introduced in 2004, to coincide with a women\'s Spring/Summer 2005 fashion collection also called "Flowerbomb." Viktor and Rolf chose the name and designed the fragrance\'s distinctive "hand grenade" bottle and gift-wrap packaging. The fragrance was a smashing success, with several flankers and limited editions being issued over the following years. A men\'s fragrance was soon to follow.\nThe pair\'s first fragrance for men, Antidote, was issued in 2006, also to coincide with a men\'s collection for their Monsieur line that was also named "Antidote."\nThe next fragrance, 2009\'s Eau Mega (a play on "Omega," the last letter in the Greek alphabet), made waves with its innovative packaging. The cap and sprayer are integrated and the perfume is dispensed by pressing a round Viktor & Rolf seal.\nA new men\'s fragrance, Spicebomb, has come out in 2012.\nDesigner Viktor&Rolf has 85 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2005 and the newest is from 2020.

She uses in her design symbolism which re-occurs in daily life, getting inspiration by people on the bus or at the market. Therefore, jeans are important in the Hardeman Language, as a point of recognition.\nHardeman describes her brand as “gender-free” rather than gender neutral. “That’s why my sizes run from XXS to XXL – it’s whatever you feel good wearing on your body”. She uses denim to break all conventions. She takes everybody’s favourite material and transforms it into deconstructed, gender fluid clothes that could not be further from your 501s.\nFrom cowboys to catwalk, HARDEMAN is the Dutch designer challenging the American denim history. With drag bar presentations and cowboy inspired films, HARDEMAN announces a re-revolution for the jeans as a symbol of freedom.\nOut of The Blue is Hardeman's first fragrance, launched in 2018.\nHardeman is a new fragrance brand.

			"Novaya Zarya is a perfume and cosmetics producing factory in Moscow, Russia. It used to be Henri Brocard’s factory in Moscow (i.e. before the Revolution in 1917) and was later nationalized and given a new, Soviet-like name – Novaya Zarya (the New Dawn).\nHenri Brocard came to Russia after his father Athanase Brocard’s failed attempt to strengthen and further develop his own cosmetics- and soap- making family business in France and later in the U.S. The competition there was too strong, yet Russia, with its aristocracy and its emerging luxury-craving bourgeoisie, seemed to be a vast and highly attractive market.\nHenri Brocard started his own factory on Moscow’s Nikolskaya street in 1861: he began by producing mass cosmetics merchandise, such as soap and tooth-powder, for the lower class. His soap was an instant hit due to its attractively low price: before that, even factory-produced soap was quite expensive.\nHis merchandise was supported by clever and humorous advertising: people on the posters were either simple civilians or peasants and the scenes depicted were often quite comical. Sample slogans in Russian announced products like ‘The National Soap’.\nRussian cosmetics market existed long before Brocard’s arrival on the scene: a huge French factory, A.Rallet & Co., founded by Alfonse Rallet in 1843, had already successfully operated in Moscow. However, Rallet’s factory mainly produced costly pomades and fragrances. After the Revolution, the factory was nationalized and got a new name as well, Svoboda (‘Freedom’), and it is still in operation.\nBrocard, happy with his initial success in Russia, started to produce high-quality cosmetics, adding essential oils and glycerine in hopes of winning a more high-profile clientele. Among others, he received shipments of the aromatic raw materials from Roure Bertrand Fils, a company based in Grasse, France.\nBrocard’s merchandise caught the interest of the royal family and quite soon the factory became the official supplier to her Royal Highness Alexandra Fiodorovna, the wife of the last Russian tsar Nicholas II. The luxurious soap that he started producing wasn’t simply high-quality, it was also highly attractive: oval or round in shape, with carved letters on each, the soap was even suitable for small children. It is highly likely that his wife, Charlotte Ravey, who grew up and studied in Russia, but was actually of Belgian descent, helped him a great deal, since she was familiar with the peculiarities of life Russia and the psychology of the Russian customer.\nIn Russia, the company listed itself as The Brocard Assotiation, which was highly typical at that time (the last name of the owner was spelled with intended omission of the final silent consonant D but with the obligatory Ъ in the end). The factory later added fragrances to its list of products. The merchandise got numerous prestigious awards on various shows and fairs, such as the ones held in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia and even Paris, France. Henri Brocard died in Cannes, France in 1900.\nThe factory was nationalized in 1917, after the Communist Revolution, and was assigned a meaningless name ‘Soap factory # 5’. Only later, in 1922, it was given the new name Novaya Zarya, which it bears still. Interestingly, Polina Zhemchuzhina, the wife of a famous Soviet politician Molotov (and a close friend of Stalin’s wife Svetlana Allilueva), was the factory’s CEO for two years (1930-1932).\nDuring WWII, the factory, like many others, was evacuated to Sverdlovsk (formerly and recently Ekaterinburg), in the Ural area. While stationed there, the factory also gave birth to a new company, a factory called Kalina (it was renamed into ‘Uralskye samotsvety’ in 1974, but later returned to its original name).\nThe factory is now being developed by its perfumer and CEO, who truly believes in future success of Russian perfumery in general. The company's most famous perfume is Krasnaya Moskva, known to every citizen of the former Soviet Union and its name is full of emotional associations.\nDesigner Novaya Zarya has 247 perfumes in our fragrance base. Novaya Zarya is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1882 and the newest is from 2018. Novaya Zarya fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Ivan Orluyk, David Graber, Auguste Michel, Alla Belfer, Marina Stepanova, Pavel Ivanov and Victoria Merkulova.",

			'The house of Slava Zaitsev was founded by Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Zaitsev known as Slava Zaitsev in Russia. He is a Russian fashion designer, painter, graphic artist and theatrical costume designer. His design is influenced by traditional Russian and Slavic styles.\nIn 1952 he enrolled in the Faculty of Applied Arts at the University of Chemistry and Technology in Ivanovo to acquire a diploma of a textile artist. He moved to Moscow in 1956, and enrolled in the Moscow Textile Institute where he acquired a diploma in painting and designing.\nZaitsev was one of the dominant figures in haute couture during the Soviet regime and was often compared with the most appreciated Western designers.\nOne of his first positions was the one of artistic director of Experimental technical garment factory in Moscow, where he was in charge of production of women\'s clothing for retail stores. He soon became well-known for designing a chic version of traditional Russian clothes, but, nevertheless, the regime did not approve production of his collection. His next position was the one of the Chief Designer at the All-Union Fashion House, known as Dom Modeli. His work caught attention of French designers and he was given nickname Red Dior.\nIt was in 1978 that he started working on his own, from a small studio, later to become «Slava Zaitsev» Moscow Fashion House or Dom Modi. It was one of the biggest Soviet couturiers who served thousands of customers and was popular among high society ladies such as the Soviet Firts Lady. In that period of time he even wrote two books covering fashion - "Such Changeable Fashion" and "This Multifaceted World of Fashion".\nAfter displaying his designer pieces in Japan and Canada, Zaitsev signed a three year contract with Intertorg Inc. in 1987, which enabled him to offer and sell his designs in the United States. Soon after he conquered Paris, joined the Maison de Couture and was named "Man of the Year in the World of Fashion".\nIn 1991 Zaitsev created his first perfume. That was a classic women perfume named Maroussia, created in collaboration with the French house of L\'Oréal. The perfume is a floral oriental and is still a favorite not only to Russian women, but to worldwide audience.\nIn 1992 Zaitsev conquered the USA and attracted a lot of attention with his fashion shows and exhibitions of his paintings, which were widely attended, an meant the beginning of cultural exchanges.\nEven the President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, appreciated Zaitsev and awarded him the State Prize of the Russian Federation in the field of literature and the arts in 1996. He was also close to President Putin ad designed an attire for his wife for the presidential pair\'s visit to teh Queen of England. Zaitsev expended his collection to menswear, as well.\nSlava Zaitsev has always remained true to his Russian roots and has therefore designed in Russian style and for Russian audience primarily.\nDesigner Slava Zaitsev has 4 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1992 and the newest is from 2009.',

She believes that creating perfume is a way of making the world a better place for living and giving people vivid emotions and inspiration. Natural craft fragrances are not as loud as traditional perfume, they are close to skin and full of subtle olfactory nuances. Acidica Perfumes fans admit that each fragrance from the collection has its own personality and mood. Everyone can find something to their liking: perfume stories about various sorts of teas, nature, elements arouse imagination and creative thinking, help to find source of inspiration deep inside. Landscapes and dreams, hidden memories, olfactory travels for everyone who likes to be different, to transform and to pick a fragrance on a whim. \nAcidica perfumes is an art project including perfume, visual arts and literature. Natural perfumes inspired Elena Pilgun, the artist from Sanct-Petersburg, Russia to draw a series of watercolor paintings.

The collection was an instant hit with critics and fashion fans alike and Agatha opened her first fashion studio in the Spanish capital. Her first collections in the 1980s and early 1990s were presented in Barcelona.\nThanks to her endless creativity Agatha had the chance to exhibit drawings in Madrid and soon thereafter she was referred to as \"one of Madrid's trendy set\". Each of her fashion shows was more thrilling and more glamorous than the previous one and while her fashion lines became more and more successful, Agatha decided to start designing shoes and tights. Her own quirky style and her creativity inspired her to design more products. The brand's stores now stock women's, men's, babies' and children's clothing, handbags, purses, scarves, umbrellas, jewellery, watches, underwear and swimwear and plenty of beautifully designed and useful items for home and kitchen.\nIn 2000 Agatha Ruiz de la Prada ventured into the world of perfumes. Agatha's unique style inspired the shapes and colors of the perfume bottles. The first scent of the brand, Flor, is a soft floral perfume for women. Agua de Agatha Ruiz de la Prada, a refreshing fragrance built around citrus notes, was released in 2002. 2004 saw the launch of the first men's fragrance named Lio. Lio is a fragrance that features aromatic notes and accords of citruses. Corazon, a soft fragrance with floral and aquatic notes, and the floral composition of Imagina hit the shelves in 2005. Beso, a fragrance with prominent notes of citruses and woods, was introduced in 2007. Oh La La!, a perfume full of fruity and gourmand notes, was presented in 2009.

It is concentrated on production of beauty and perfumery products. The year of 1940 meant the first turnstone in the company—since the fragrance Agua Lavanda Puig was launched. The company headquarters were moved to the center of Barcelona and stayed there till today. Antonio’s four sons joined their father’s business and inherited it gradually. Two of them concentrated on perfumery, one of diversification and one on institutional relations.\nIt was in the 1960s that the house started working on the keys to the company’s future expansion. A team of talented people who were able to value a family-owned company was formed. It improved the quality of products by building perfumery and cosmetics laboratories. The company also collaborates with other laboratories on research and applies industrial design to their products. Puig worked on internationalization and opened the first overseas division in 1959, in the USA. Collaboration with Paco Rabanne started and a perfume factory was founded in Chartres in France.\nA crucial event in the 1980s was signing the contract with Carolina Herrera to create and market all her fragrances. The success with her perfumes spread into the area of fashion industry and the company started producing Herrera’s fashion. In late 1990 one of the first celebrities who created their personal fragrances, Antonio Banderas, formed an agreement for production with Puig. The company’s business grew more and more and they turned on acquiring even more brands and expanding the portfolio of their products. They moved on with Nina Ricci in 1998.\nPerfumes, cosmetics and fashion were gathered in a holding company named Puig Beauty & Fashion company in 1999. Running the company was taken over by third-generation members and some non-members participating in decision-making processes. After closing deals with several popular Spanish brand, Puig closed one with Comme de Garcons, to distribute and create their products. Puig also worked on development of cosmetics and perfumes for Prada.\nAnother successful collaboration with a famous artist started in 2008 with worldwide star Shakira. The company developed a line of new signature products inspired by and created for the singer. It is in 2009 that the company changed its name what it is today—simply, Puig. A license agreement was signed with Valentino to launch their new fragrance. One of the latest success was acquiring a majority stake in the Jean Gaultier fashion house.\nPuig is a brand builder specializing in translating fashion brands images into the world of perfume!\nDesigner Antonio Puig has 35 perfumes in our fragrance base.

The first boutiques that were opened were the ones in Spain before more shops opened their doors to customers in Europe, North America and Asia.\nThe first real fashion collection that encompassed all kinds of ladies' wear was presented in 1986. Since then several lines of ladies' wear and men's wear, shoes, bags, accessories, watches, sunglasses, belts, homewear and fragrances were launched. Today the brand aims at middle and upper middle class young professionals of both sexes in the age group of 25-35. The creative heads behind the fashion and lifestyle brand Armand Basi translate their concept of urbanity, individuality, modernity and style into fashionable garments that appeal to their targeted customer base.\nIn order to define their style on the next level, Armand Basi broke into new terrain: Fragrances. Armand Basi Homme is a woody, spicy and warm scent for men with dominant notes of benzoin, cinnamon, vanilla, sandalwood, nutmeg, lavender and incense. Armand Basi Femme is a fragrance for women that is built around citruses, coriander, violet, jasmine, rose, cassia, musk, vanilla and amber. In Blue, another fragrance for men, features intense notes of citruses, woods and spices. The ladies version, In Red, is composed of prominent notes of citruses, ginger, lily and woody notes. Lovely Blossom, a creation by Francis Kurkdijan, is a happy floral-fruity fragrance with main notes of plum, apricot, jasmine, orange blossom, heliotrope and woody notes.\nDesigner Armand Basi has 23 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1999 and the newest is from 2019. Armand Basi fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Olivier Cresp, Jean-Pierre Bethouart, Fabrice Pellegrin, Quentin Bisch, Nathalie Lorson, Francis Kurkdjian, Veronique Nyberg, Olivier Pescheux, Annick Menardo, Sylvie Fischer, Alberto Morillas, Francoise Caron and Alienor Massenet.",

Training since childhood as a tailor, Balenciaga is notable for being one of the few designers who could design, cut and sew his own designs. He achieved success in Spain just after World War I, but the Spanish Civil War prompted a move to Paris.\nHe rose to prominence in the post-World War II years, with his architectural designs. His work helped popularize the tunic dress, chemise dress and empire waistlines on dresses and coats. Balenciaga retired and closed his haute couture houses in 1968, and passed away in Spain in 1972.\nThe Balenciaga name continues to offer clothing and accessories today, as part of the Gucci group and under the direction of Nicholas Ghesquiere.\nThe first fragrance introduced under the Balenciaga name was Le Dix, in 1947.

			'Jesus Del Pozo was a Spanish fashion designer born in Madrid in 1946. Opening his first boutique in 1974, Del Pozo was embarking on his career at the same time as Spain was beginning to transition from the dictatorship of Franco to democracy. The change in politics coincided with a change in social values now described as La Movida. Del Pozo, as an artist and designer, played an important part in this "Movement" and was regarded as a key influence in the modernization of Spanish style.\nFrom his boutique on Almirante Street—a hub of the cultural vanguard in Madrid—Del Pozo took inspiration from the past and married it with his own unique personal vision to move fashion forward in Spain. While not forgetting the lessons of past Spanish masters of couture, such as Cristobal Balenciaga, Del Pozo sought the individual beauty of a possible creation and how to present it without gimmicks or unnecessary embellishments. A 2010 quote sums up his philosophy: "I love women and I love promoting the positive. I do not want uniformity. It is important that each person brings something of his personality, so I try to do flexible and adaptive fashion." An "intellectual" designer whose thoughtful approach included research and discussion, many have likened his designs to art, in particular sculpture, moreso than fashion.\nOriginally desiging for men, his women\'s designs would ultimately prove more successful. His first collection was shown in 1976. Del Pozo would go on to receive the Golden Needle award in 1981, National Award Cristobal Balenciaga in 1989, and he was the first fashion designer to receive the Gold Medal for Merit in Fine Arts in 1998.\nIn the 1990s, Del Pozo made several lucrative moves that brought greater success to the house. He began desinging ready-to-wear and bridal wear, and in 1992, introduced his first perfume, Duende for women. Perfumes became an important piece of the Del Pozo brand\'s offering, with Halloween (1997) becoming an international best-seller and spinning off a series of limited editions and flankers in future years.\nDel Pozo passed away in August 2011, leaving behind a legacy of beautiful fashions for an important time in Spain\'s history, as well as a legacy of education and professionalism in the fashion industry.\nDesigner Jesus Del Pozo has 21 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1992 and the newest is from 2019.

			"Salvador Domènec Felip Jacint Dalí i Domènech, Marquis de Púbol (May 11, 1904 – January 23, 1989), commonly known as Salvador Dalí was a prominent Spanish Catalan surrealist artist of the 20th century.\nThis talented and imaginative man is best-known for his paintings, but Dali mastered several arts in his lifetime, including film, sculpture, and photography, collaborating with artists across a variety of media. Dalí trained at the San Fernando Academy of Fine Arts, where he cultivated his eccentric personal style and rubbed elbows with other notable artists and writers of the day, including filmmaker Luis Bunuel and poet Federico Garcia Lorca.\nEarly realistic paintings such as Basket of Bread gave way to experiments with Cubism and eventually resulted in the Surrealistic style for which he became known.\nDalí held a one-man show in Paris in 1929, where he met his muse and future wife, Gala Eluard. The two became a pair and eventually married. Dalí's most famous picture, The Persistence of Memory, with its melting watch faces, was painted in 1931 and brought considerable fame to Dalí in the United States, where he and Gala became part of the lively social scene. The pair moved to New York with the advent of World War II and resided there from 1940 to 1948.\nDalí moved out of Surrealism into what is described as his \"classical\" period, creating a series of 19 large canvases that explored religious, historical and scientific themes. He returned to Catalonia in 1949 and would spend his remaining years there, facing criticism for choosing to live under Franco-ruled Spain. During this time he filmed television commercials, designed logos for a candy and the Eurovision song contest, and explored new art media. His wife, Gala, passed away in 1982, after which Dalí's health suffered considerably. Dalí passed away from heart failure in 1989, leaving behind a large body of work in a variety of media.\nPerfumery does not seem an illogical choice, given the variety of interests and expertise of this celebrated artist. A famous Dalí quote conceptualizes the perfume line: \"Of the five senses, the sense of smell is incontestably the one that best conveys a sense of immortality.\" A partnership with Cofinluxe was already underway, and the scent that would become the first fragrance, 1983's Salvador Dalí, had been chosen by Dali and Gala before her death. Gala was purportedly an intense perfumista with a large collection, and with a fondness for roses, which figure prominently in the scent. The bottle's design was inspired by Dalí's painting, Apparition of The Face of Aphrodite of Knidos, with its well-formed lips and nose. Intended as a limited edition, the fragrance was a success and was offered to the international market in 1985. A men's companion scent was produced in 1987, and to date, more than 25 perfumes have been introduced under the Salvador Dalí label, all with interesting packaging inspired by Dalí's artwork.\nDesigner Salvador Dali has 73 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1983 and the newest is from 2019.

The newlyweds combined their talents, experience and creativity in developing the jewelry business. In 1985, the company's signature \"bear\" design was developed by Rosa Oriol, inspired by a teddy bear she saw on her travels and sought to recapture in gold. The success of the Tous bear—a good luck charm for many—has allowed the company to expand internationally. The Tous bear is always present in their collections in some form.\nTous remains a family business today.

			"Zara is a Spanish clothing and accessories brand based in Arteixo, Galicia. It was founded by Amancio Ortega and Rosalía Mera. They opened the first Zara store in 1975, and their original product line featured inexpensive lookalike products of popular designer fashions. The store was highly successful, and Ortega began opening more Zara stores throughout Spain.\nDuring the 1980s, Ortega started changing the design, manufacturing, and distribution process of Zara to enable quick production of fashions in response to current trends. The company took advantage of improvements in information technology, and the economy of scale achieved by using groups of designers. Ortega describes his method and the company's offerings as \"instant fashions.\" How quickly a design can be turned out is rumored to be just two weeks, from development to placement in stores. This contrasts sharply with the six-month industry average. As a result of its streamlined processes, Zara is able to launch around thousands of new designs each year. The rapid appearance and disappearance of a given design builds excitement in Zara's customers.\nZara has resisted the industry-wide trend towards transferring fast fashion production to inexpensive foreign labor. Zara is part of the Inditex group, which was founded in 1985 as the primary holding company of Zara's enterprises. Inditex is one of the world's largest distribution companies, which is integral to Zara's \"instant fashion\" concept, and also serves other retailers held by Inditex.\nAnother unusual strategy was Zara's policy of zero advertising. Funds that most businesses invest in advertising are instead set aside for the opening of new stores.\nIn 1980, the company started its international expansion, opening a store in Porto, Portugal. In 1989 it entered the United States and in 1990, it expanded to France, in the first of a series of international expansions in the decade. As of 2011, Zara has retail presence in 78 countries.\nZara stores are company-owned unless local legislation forbids foreign-owned businesses. Zara franchises their stores in these markets.\nZara expanded into home goods in 2003, and began offering fragrances, in collaboration with esteemed Spanish perfume house Puig, starting in 1998.\nDesigner Zara has 478 perfumes in our fragrance base.

In the frame of Monistrol de Montserrat, Saberi settles his first headquarter, later transferred in Barcelona. Monistrol as well as the current atelier stand for the geographical exemplifications of a secular spirituality, as in these industrial archaeology sites Boris develops the outlines of his alchemist laboratory for contemporary investigations.\nFollowing the inception of the brand, Boris Bidjan Saberi began participating in the official Paris Fashion Week calendar where he nowadays presents his collections. The label increased a distinctive attention for functional qualities, whilst maintaining a strong connection to urban roots. Since 2014, Boris Bidjan Saberi is an official member of the Chambre masculine of the Federation Française de la Couture.\nThe designer matures a peculiar clothing language through the celebration of his innate heritage between European and Middle-Eastern culture. It is therefore the burst of an instinctive primitiveness in which raw materials and accurate tailoring fuse together.\nBoris Bidjan Saberi launched his first fragrance in 2016.\nBoris Bidjan Saberi is a new fragrance brand.

They adapt to you, taking on exclusively personal characteristics. They interact with your personal aroma and evolve with you. They breathe with you.\nThis is our personal interpretation of the wildest side of the Alt Empordà. The three fragrances, BOSC, MUGA and CALA, suggest an olfactory journey, from the humid forests of the Albera Massif and the Salines Mountains, following down the Muga River across the plain, and over to the rough coves of the Cap de Creus peninsula.\nThey are done with tinctures and hydrolates from local plants, which we gather in their natural settings. All our oil essences are premium quality and 100% natural.\nAs our captured scents do not have synthetic fixers that block their natural evolution, they are masculine for men and feminine for women. They adjust themselves to the way that each and every person really is. Because nature is full of surprises.\nIf you so desire, we can visit you to capture the essence of your personal landscape. The one you gaze at through the window, the fragrance of the garden you grew up near or even the scent of a memorable celebration. Just for you, we will capture a part of what you are.

			"Custo Dalmau, known as Custo Barcelona, is Spanish designer, who started his own business (clothes design, print, graphic design, collections for men and women) with his brother in 1980. This year he started a successful cooperation with Idesa Parfumes, Spanish brand, which presented popular perfumes for Mandarina Duck, Angel Schlesser, Alejandro Sanz, Joaquín Cortés and Anne Möller so far. This house is also an exclusive distributor for Versace, Moschino, Dsquared2 and Salvatore Ferragamo's perfumes for the area of Spain.\nThe inspiration for the brand was the brothers' long trip during which they travelled all around the world and discovered various artistic, cultural and philosophical expressions. They got particularly interested in the typical Californian style they saw on surfers and the psychedelic look. Colorful and innovative fashion trends caught their eye and tehy desided to bring the style back with them to Spain. Those were the beginnings of the brand launched under the name “Custo Line”. The brothers learnt a lot about printing techniques, finishings and graphic design, which brought them to their colorful, innovative and bold design. They started with production of printed tops, and expanded to all other clothing items, as well as to fashion accessories and fragrances.\nThe first perfume by the house was presented in October 2008. It is an edition for women, an eternal combination of fashion, culture, journeys and mysterious secrets which will be revealed by the future. This modern edition was presented in creator Custo Barcelona's style: with a wide range of colours and unusual modernistic expression worth your attention.\nPerfume Custo Barcelona is a warm perfume, which introduces sensual experience, full of spices, life, joy and power. The woman who will use it is a real cosmopolite, has adventurous spirit, is unconventional and open to styles of future. Custo Dalmau - Custo Barcelona received the Glamour Award, in category best women's fragrance, on May 20th 2009 for this perfume. Creator of this edition is perfumer Alberto Morillas.\nThe bottle and the package are modern and revolutionary since they are made of various materials. Such a mixture of structures and rough surfaces has not been used in production of bottles and packages yet. Creators Pati Núñez and Toni Arola were in charge of design of the new edition.\nIt is interesting that curves of the bottles and the whole package were inspired by the city of Barcelona, its coasts, impressive architecture and even by sunset. Rough granite material reminds of the coasts of Barcelona, glass reflects liveliness of Custo Barcelona's hometown with name Custo carved in pink glass. Shape of the bottle was created thanks to modern expression of young architects who project the future of Barcelona in an impressive way. The top of the bottle stands for top modern skyscrapers of the unusual Spanish town.\nThis avant-garde and exclusive seal by creator Custo Barcelona was made in a harmonious game of different elements.\nCusto Barcelona presented his first fragrance for men, Custo Men in October 2009. The sweet, sexy, optimistic and spicy new fragrance by Custo Barcelona was created in cooperation with perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, as an eternal combination of fashion, beauty, journey, culture and mysterious secrets. Flacon of the masculine edition Custo Man repeats the theme of the previous year's edition while combining various materials: green glass and metal board, decorated with relief names. Its stopper is eccentric and shows escape from conformism.\nIn 2010 the collection was rounded with a fragrant pair for men and women - Pure Custo Barcelona Man and Pure Custo Barcelona Woman. Freedom and freshness are part of the purest concept behind these two fragrances. They are both characterized by a pure spirit. They express Pure Fashion and contain Pure Innovation. The peacock found on packaging and on ad campaign is taken as a symbol of the very essence of the brand and of the new perfumes.\nDesigner Custo Barcelona has 9 perfumes in our fragrance base. Custo Barcelona is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2008 and the newest is from 2014.

			"Spanish duo Victorio and Lucchino established excellent cooperation through combination of talents of the brand's founder and partner, José Victor Rodríguez Caro and José Luis Medina del Corral.\nCaro comes from Palma del Rio, Cordoba, and he was born during the 1950es. His inspiration is set towards Paris and French creators, who had strong influence on Spanish fashion media, i.e. fashion magazines. In his younger days, when he was a teenager, he worked as an assistant for some fashion companies, preparing their collections.\nDeel Corral was also born during the 1950, but he comes from Sevilla. He was sure that he would be doing his current job back when he was very young. He started working for a company in Sevilla, where Caro was working, so this is where they met and started their cooperation.\nAfter only several months, they started a company together - \"Victorio y Lucchino\". The style of this house is full-blooded Spanish. Their creations are created in Andalusian style, since this is where the team used to live and work. The soul of Andalusia lives in coexistence of Catholics, Arabs and Jews, and is therefore intertwined not only with different religions, but also with various customs and lifestyle. Colours, textures and scents stimulated their style in design.\nThe surroundings influenced their work. They were inspired by religious rituals known from that section, such as Phoenician Goddesses of Estarta, whose pieces of jewelry contained incense, myrrh and amber inside them. Spanish culture had a great influence on their fashion, as well. Out of Spanish baroque, famous Carmen and Hispano culture they created a popular mixture, which spread slowly throughout Europe and the whole world.

			"The company Byredo was founded by Ben Gorham in Stockholm in Sweden in 2006. Byredo focuses on quality and all their products are made in Sweden. Their current line includes perfumes and home fragrance, body care products and accessoires. Gorham, a heavily tattooed former basketball player obsessed with the power of scents since his adolescence, is the son of an Indian mother and a French-Canadian father who grew up in Sweden and, later, in Canada. He graduated from The School of Arts in Stockholm and met perfumer Pierre Wulff, who he convinced to reflect his ideas in fragrant creations, by chance. Byredo was launched shortly after and is now synonymous with fine fragrances.\nOlivia Giacobetti and Jerome Epinette are the perfumers he now works with on the creation of his mostly unisex fragrances. Ben relies on his fragrant memories and experiences from his past that all the fragrances are based on. The perfumes are inspired by places, feelings or certain scents and smells that relate to them: Palermo for women from 2010 is inspired by the city of Palermo in Sicily. Bal d'Afrique's inspiration is the city of Paris in the 1920s and the Parisians fascination with African culture, art and music. Green, his first fragrance composed of notes of petit grain, sage, jasmine, rose, honeysuckle, violet, tonka bean, almond and musk, was inspired by Gorham's childhood memories of his father.\nByredo's fragrances have come to life thanks to Ben Gorham's immense creativity and his unique approach to designing a fragrance. He keeps the formulas simple and avoids too many notes that may clash. He prefers fragrances with rather fewer notes, because, according to him, their existence is justified.\nByredo currently trade from a stand-alone store in Stockholm and several concessions all over the world. The fragrances, designed for the tastes of niche perfume lovers, can be found at exclusive department stores and boutiques, e.g. at Liberty's in London and, where the fragrances are best-sellers, at Barney's in the USA.\nWhile the focus of the brand is on unisex fragrance, Byredo has launched a few fragrances determined for women and a few fragrances classified as \"for men\".\nDesigner Byredo has 56 perfumes in our fragrance base.

		title: "Charriol",
		description:
			"Charriol is a Swiss house specialized in luxury of jewelry, fine Swiss watches and other accessories. The company was established in 1983, in Geneva by Philippe Charriol, a French entrepreneur. After the first Charriol boutique in Geneva, three stores were opened in Hong Kong. Today the house has over 40 boutiques in all parts of the world. Motto of the house is: ‘L'art de vivre la difference’ meaning 'the art of living the difference,'\nThe company is best known for their luxury watches, made whether of 18kt gold or steel. The most popular collections are Actor, Alexandre, Colvmbvs, Rotonde by Charriol, Saint Tropez, and Parisii .\nIn designing his maiden collection in 1983 - the Celtic Collection Philippe Charriol was inspired by Celtic culture. He first used a gold cable, or steel cable, as a decorative motif and as a watch bracelet. It was patented later and CHARRIOL still holds exclusive worldwide rights over it, which makes his style distinct and known worldwide. The house even wanted to protect the Celtic twisted rope as their trademark in jewelry design, but the court refused.\nIn 1989 the house expanded their collection with writing instruments and leather goods. A few years later, the company opened the first boutiques in the USA and China. It was in 1999 that the brand changed its name from Philippe Charriol to Charriol.\nThe first fragrances by Charriol were launched in 2008. That were one fragrance for women Pour Femme Eau de Toilette and one for men, Charriol Pour Homme for men. The fragrances were first launched in Asia and the Middle East. Many other fragrances for women and women followed in the upcoming years. Charriol's flacons for women's flacons are characteristic of the brand – they are striking, circle-shaped, framed in Charriol's characteristic motif of spiral steel cable, with a relief in transparent glass.\nPhilippe Charriol described his style the following way: ‘I have composed my style as an alchemist: marrying classicism and modernity together, as a pleasant balance of sobriety and exuberance, but always attentive to quality and never losing sight of the functional aspect. I have further enhanced my watch collections to encompass a broad range of products which now include jewelry, leather goods, writing instruments, travel ware, eyewear, and fragrances. These affordable accessories serve to complete an image, a spirit, and a look, allowing customers to access the CHARRIOL universe with ease, before moving on to a more upscale acquisition such as prestige watch or a piece of gold jewelry.’\nDesigner Charriol has 19 perfumes in our fragrance base. Charriol is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2008 and the newest is from 2019. Charriol fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Guillaume Flavigny, Philippe Bousseton, Dominique Ropion, Michel Almairac, Richard Ibanez, Mylene Alran, Marie Salamagne, Mathilde Bijaoui, Raphael Haury, Christian Vermorel, Annick Menardo and Sidonie Lancesseur.",

		title: "Chopard",
		description:
			"Chopard is a Swiss watchmaker and jewelry house founded by Louis-Ulysse Chopard in 1860. Founded in the small Swiss village of Sonvillier, Chopard's initial focus was on precision timepieces, in the Swiss tradition. Chopard manufactures many of the watch components in-house, rather than creating watches from parts created in other factories. The company's reputation for quality and reliability spread quickly, and the founder's son, Paul Louis, opened a second branch in La Chaux de Fonds, along with the relocation of the company's headquarters, in 1921. The company moved to Geneva, then the world capital of Haute Horlogerie (\"Fine Watchmaking\") in 1937. Great grand-son Paul Andre Chopard took over the company in 1943. In 1963, the company sought a buyer who could continue the family's rich heritage of fine timepiece production, and the company was sold to Karl Scheufele, from a noted German watchmaking family.\nChopard experienced tremendous growth under the Scheufele family, who modernized the company and expanded its expertise into fine jewelry. The famed \"Happy Diamonds\" collection, whose watches featued free-moving diamonds housed between sapphire crystals, and the first Sport watches on leather straps, were all introduced under Scheufele's direction.\nScheufele has kept Chopard a family business, with daughter Caroline as the head of the fine jewelry division, and son Karl-Friedrich overseeing the watchmaking division. The company has three manufacturing sites in Switzerland and offers its products in exclusive boutiques and distribution outlets throughout the world.\nChopard partnered with the Cannes Film Festival and redesigned the award for the Palme d'Or (\"Golden Palm\") in 1998. Chopard also sponsors the Male and Female Revelation of the Year awards at Cannes.\nIn 1992, Chopard partnered with L'Oreal to release fine fragrances under the esteemed Chopard brand. The company's first fragrance, sweet and popular women's fragrance Casmir, debuted in 1992 to great success, and spawned a series of flankers. The first men's scent, Heaven, was introduced in 1994. The company offers many of its fragrances in flacons that resemble a gemstone (Wish, for example, from 1999) and has introduced fragrances that coincide with a watch or jewelry collection, such as the Happy Spirit fragrances, which have a corresponding timepiece collection.\nDesigner Chopard has 57 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1986 and the newest is from 2020. Chopard fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Nathalie Lorson, Thierry Wasser, Michel Almairac, Alberto Morillas, Mark Buxton, Olivier Polge, Bruno Jovanovic, Emilie (Bevierre) Coppermann, Jean-Christophe Herault, Dominique Ropion, Veronique Nyberg, Dora Baghriche, Alienor Massenet, Christine Nagel, Amandine Clerc-Marie, Nicolas Beaulieuu, Lucas Sieuzac, Nathalie Feisthauer, Louise Turner, Michel Girard, Alexandra Jouet and Ursula Wandel.",

Each scent is a unique artwork in a modern flacon of clear, streamlined design. Each of the unconventional concepts behind the highly individual perfume creations reflects a different facet of the entire spectrum of human emotion – from fury to elation.\nHUMIECKI & GRAEF represents a bold new dimension in the luxury perfume market. It revisits the traditional market methodology, reinterprets and reorganizes its component parts – from the development of fragrance concepts to the realization of the perfumes, through to the packaging and presentation. When it came to naming the brand, the two designers chose the maiden names of their respective centenarian grandmothers, creating a very special, fragrant memorial to two extraordinary women.\nThe Perfumers and the Perfumes The HUMIECKI & GRAEF fragrances were created in close collaboration with Christophe Laudamiel and Christoph Hornetz – aka LES CHRISTOPHS – who are among the world’s top perfumers. The duo are known for “pushing the envelope” of their profession in pursuit of artistic visions, using the most advanced methods of perfumery to realize them. Every emotion is characterized by several different feelings experienced virtually simultaneously. The unconventional star-shaped “fragrance architecture” chosen by LES CHRISTOPHS for HUMIECKI & GRAEF perfumes enables them to reflect this phenomenon. Perfumer Laudamiel comments on the project: “The exceedingly sophisticated concepts and ideas for each fragrance were so forceful and challenging that I had to break with convention. I felt it was imperative to create each of the fragrances absolutely individually, which is a very unusual approach in contemporary perfumery.” Containing 20-25% perfume oils, the “Eaux de Toilettes Concentrées” from HUMIECKI & GRAEF have a higher perfume oil concentration than most Eaux de Perfumes.\nDesigner Humiecki & Graef has 15 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			".vero.profumo. is a Swiss niche line established in 2007 by perfumer Vero Kern. First three fragrances launched in May 2007. Three years after first launch, Vero introduced the same fragrances in eau de parfum (with slightly changed compositions).\nA trained perfumer and aromatologist, Vero Kern invested five years in creating her first three extraits de parfum. The small flacons contain a highly concentrated fragrance extract which is applied directly to the skin using the cap of the flacon. The effect is sensual, erotic and alluring. .vero.profumo. is a happy marriage of old and new, traditional handcraft and contemporary high-tech. The three fragrances for the .vero.profumo. market launch are Onda, Kiki and Rubj. Each of these creations encapsulates a unique feminine world in miniature.\nPerfumes from .vero.profumo. are made in the tradition of the great classics like Chanel No 5, Guerlain Shalimar and Mitsouko. The compounds contain a high proportion of natural essences. The essential oils and absolutes dominate, in proportions of 60 to 90 percent in relation to the synthetic essences. Perfumes with a high proportion of natural essences are distinguished by a complex, living structure that cannot be compared with that of perfumes which contain only synthetic components.\nSince standardised large-scale product flacons are almost the only type available on the market today, Vero Kern employed the services of a niche supplier, a long-established glassworks in Normandy that has been run by the same family for more than a hundred years, to create exactly the flacon she wanted. This is traditional glassmaking, where the glass is fired in old-fashioned ovens.\nThe shape of the flacon that emerged is reminiscent of the 1940s. To protect the precious essences inside from the effects of sunlight, dark amber, or ambre foncé, was chosen as the colour of the glass. The old method of dying the glass right through is followed, instead of simply spraying the colour on. The .vero.profumo. logo is printed on the glass. The stopper sits well between the fingers, thanks to a large, slightly indented textured surface.\n  Designer Vero Profumo has 16 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2007 and the newest is from 2017. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Vero Kern.",

It is through my longstanding work with seeing impaired people that I have been able to improve and refine this knowledge with regard to essences, ingredients and aromas, and their beneficial effects. During the various therapeutic methods that I have applied on my students, I began to experiment with scents as a way of reaching out to them and penetrating the doors of their sealed world. Eventually I began to create my own blends of essential oils, which in turn led me to attend the perfume academy in Grasse ASFO (Centre de formation professionnel aux métiers des parfums, des arômes et de la cosmétique). My vision to found my own label has been fulfilled. As a skilled perfumer and scent designer, I now have the immense joy of creating personal and unique fragrances. My ideas for fragrances originate in my mind and then travel to the nose. “My ideas begin to take shape as I visualize lush, green alpine meadows, feeling herbs, casting my mind on different feelings and experiences. Only then do I begin mixing and blending the numerous essences.” In my perfume studio in Bern called Art of Scent-Swiss Perfumes, I create perfumes, room fragrances and personalized scents. Carefully chosen essences and harmonious blends are utilized in crafting original creations in fulfilling customer requests.

The business began when Alfred Dunhill, just 21 years of age, took over his father's saddlery business, in 1893. The automobile was an exciting new piece of technology being developed at the time, and Dunhill transformed the saddlery into an automobile accessories store. Among the company's first offerings were such non-standard (at the time) accoutrements as horns, lamps and dashboard clocks. Dunhill also made leather overcoats, goggles and other accessories for drivers.\nIn 1907, another business transformation took place when Duhill opened a tobacco shop, followed in 1910 by his own pipe factory. The company's pipes are distinguished by their trademarked \"White Spot.\" Tobacco proved a more successful venture for the company and allowed for expansion with shops in Paris and New York.\nLighters have been an important staple in the Dunhill stock. Dunhill was the first company to develop a lighter that could be operated with one hand. The company's distinct Rollagas butane lighter was launched in the 1950s. A special gunmetal edition of this lighter was produced by Dunhill for use in the James Bond film, \"Dr. No.\" Dunhill also began manufacturing its own cigarette brand in 1963.\nThe Dunhill shopping experience is designed to delight the male luxury goods consumer from start to finish. The retail stores are known as \"Homes,\" and allow the shopper to purchase clothing, luxury accessories and fine wines, followed by a haircut in the onsite barbershop, with a spa treatment to pass time while waiting for the next film to begin in the screening room.\nDunhill revitalized its brand in 2005, introducing its luxury products to a new generation of customers and reaffirming the importance of menswear to the brand by the appointment of its first-ever Creative Director, Kim Jones.\nDunhill fragrances, like the brand's other products, are designed for the male luxury consumer. The company has produced just one female fragrance to date—2001's Desire. The first men's fragrance under the brand was offered in 1934, the original Dunhill for Men.\nDesigner Alfred Dunhill has 31 perfumes in our fragrance base. Alfred Dunhill is an old perfume house.

This collection brings together elements of Britain’s history, both imagined and real, to create collages of scent embodying themes of warfare, trade and exploration.\nCrabtree\'s lifelong love of fragrance and a preoccupation with the darker elements of British history served as the collection’s impetus. Born into a diverse family comprised of artists, psychologists and sailors, Crabtree’s first home was a boat on the River Thames. “The sea, its traditions, superstitions and way of life are ingrained in me. The brand\'s name BeauFort London (derived from the 1805 wind force scale conjured up by Naval Officer Sir Francis Beaufort) represents a kind of framework within which we can understand ourselves," notes Crabtree. "The wind is constant, enduring, but ultimately changeable and potentially destructive.”\nCrabtree worked closely with the most accomplished perfumers in Great Britain to create fragrances that tap the window of the nation\'s collective subconscious, endeavoring to cast light on moments past, with fragments of shared history brought fleetingly to life and carried on the wind.\nDesigner BeauFort London has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base.

The brand is globally successful.\nfcuk, then called French Connection UK, discovered the (in)famous acronym (fcuk) in 1997 and has since then used the controversy around it to rebrand their clothes and stores and to create publicity which in return boosted sales. The manufacture of shirts with controversial slogans that centered around the acronym 'fcuk' printed on them have been bestsellers for years. Still, some puns have been deemed inappropriate and have been pulled by the label.\nThe acronym fcuk has created many a stir around the world. It began with a judge expelling a juror from court for wearing a t-shirt with fcuk print on it. The most prominent case was the Mayor of Boston who was campaigning against the brand with the help of The American Family Association who called for a boycott of fcuk's shops and merchandise.\nApart from all the controversy, fcuk is a successful brand with hundreds of outlets all over the world and department store concessions all over the UK.

The Ghost fashion line was a favorite with celebrities and real women everywhere who embraced its comfort, generous sizing and flattering cuts.\nPerfumes were a valued piece of the Ghost product offering, with the launch of the first scent, Ghost Perfume, in 1995.

The original name of the company was Swallow Sidecar Company. After the Second World War the company name was eventually changed to Jaguar. Jaguar, who had also ventured into the car manufacturing sector, then merged with the British Motor Corporation. In 1984, the year they were listed on the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar became part of the FTSE100 Index until their acquisition by Ford in 1989.\nJaguar's first commercial success after the Second World War was the presentation of a range of appealing sports cars. Despite their high price tags, they were considered as value for money as they came with many of luxury features. Jaguar made a name for themselves by the construction of powerful engines that were built into street cars and Grand Prix winning racing cars. In the 1950s the house managed to win the 24 hours race in Le Mans, France, for four times.\nUnder the Ford umbrella, Jaguar expanded its product portfolio and launched the legendary cars S-Type and R-Type in 1999 and 2001, respectively. In 2008 Jaguar was sold to the Indian company Tata Motors.\nIn 1988 Jaguar launched their first fragrance for men. Jaguar for men features notes of orange, lavender, green notes, mandarin orange, cassia, basil, grapefruit, anise and bergamot, cyclamen, nutmeg, carnation, gardenia, cinnamon, jasmine, caraway, sage, rose and geranium, leather, sandalwood, tonka bean, amber, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, vanilla, cedar and tobacco.\nMiss Jaguar, a floral fragrance for women, was launched in 1993.

Her lifelong fondness for all things fragrant began as a child, when she tried to produce her own fragrances using flowers from the family garden and grated soap.\nWorking as a florist by day and a beautician who did facials by night, her business took off when the Nutmeg and Ginger bath oil she produced as a thank-you gift for clients led to requests for re-orders. In 1994, Jo Malone opened her first boutique in London, offering fragrances, skin care, and home scents. A flagship boutique on London's famed Sloane Street was opened in 1999.\nJo was an early advocate for the concept of combining fragrances. Her unisex scents often focused on a single note or a simple combination of two or three essences. The scents were designed to be worn alone or with other scents in the collection, allowing the wearer to create a custom scent—or a variety of them—by layering the different scents on the skin.\nThe simple but elegant cream-colored packaging with black trim perfectly embodied the tasteful, often subtle and dignified scents in the line.\nThe success of Jo Malone caught the eye of a beauty industry giant. Estee Lauder Companies acquired the Jo Malone brand in 1999, and Jo remained with the company as its chairwoman and creative director until 2006. Estee Lauder Companies continues to operate and produce new scents under the Jo Malone brand. With the financial backing of Estee Lauder Companies, the Jo Malone brand has expanded its distribution to numerous countries around the world.\nIn November 2011, designer Jo Malone announced a return to the fragrance industry with the formation of a new brand, Jo Loves, currently available for sale in the UK.\nDesigner Jo Malone London has 137 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Kate got her start as a model at age 16, and would go on to become one of the most in-demand print models whose appeal continues today, with a career spanning more than 20 years.\nKate Moss has modeled for top designers including Calvin Klein, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Chanel and Bvlgari. She has been the face of cosmetics company Rimmel since 2005.\nIn 2007, Kate—always known as a tastemaker and credited for helping popularize such diverse trends as Ugg boots, skinny jeans, denim cut-offs and the "boho-chic" look—took a turn behind the scenes with a line of clothing produced for British retailer Topshop. Kate partnered with luxury leather goods producer Longchamp to launch a line of Kate Moss handbags, starting in 2010.\nKate\'s rock\'n\'roll lifestyle has been a popular subject for tabloids and the media.

			'Lush is a UK-based cosmetic company, founded by Mark and Mo Constantine. Lush has its roots in the cosmetology industry. Mark Constantine was a trained trichologist (specializing in health of the hair and scalp), and a partnership with beauty therapist Liz Weir led to the formation of the "Herbal Hair and Beauty Clinic" in 1977, for which Constantine and Weir blended their own products.\nThe hand-blended, botanical based products were unlike other commercial products in use at the time and caught the eye of another British beauty entrepreneur, Anita Roddick (founder of The Body Shop.) Constantine and Weir PLC began producing products for fledgling The Body Shop stores, while continuing to focus on their own clinic and business ventures. Constantine and Weir were eventually bought out by Ms. Roddick in 1984.\nConstantine and Weir established a new venture called Cosmetics to Go in 1987. As a mail-order company, the company marketed its products exclusively through catalogs. This venture was eventually sold to partner Jeff Brown, who had been a fragrance designer for the company.\nThe company we know as Lush today began in 1994, under the name "Cosmetic House." The Lush name (trademarked as LUSH, in capital letters) was adopted in 1995, having been chosen by a customer who entered a contest. Using fresh fruits, vegetables, plants and safe synthetic ingredients, the company began making soaps and body care products and marketing them through a small store in Poole. Daily specials were advertised on a chalk board placed outside the store. The products attracted former customers of Cosmetics to Go and eventually, investors, allowing them to open additional stores in Covent Garden and Kings Road. The first Lush store overseas was opened in Canada, with more stores and Lush factories eventually opening in 40 countries including the US, Japan and across Europe.\nLush products are famous for their minimalist, eco-friendly packaging, avoidance of animal ingredients and stance against animal testing, as well as for their beautiful aromas. Lush launched a focused perfume company called B Never Too Busy To Be Beautiful in 2003, with fragrances developed by Mark and and his son, Simon Constantine. B Never was unable to show a profit as a stand-alone company, and the perfumes developed under the brand were absorbed by Lush in 2009. The perfumes are today marketed through the Lush stores and catalogs under the moniker "Gorilla Perfumes."\nDesigner Lush has 115 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			"Marks and Spencer was founded by Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer in 1894 with the opening of their first store in Manchester. The original company name and the name of the brand that clothes and food were sold under was St. Michael. They were famous for selling products that were made in Britain only and developed many long-term partnerships with several manufacturers and suppliers. Food and clothes were the items that the company's product portfolio consisted of. 1974 was the year that Asian food, a staple of today's British shopping basket, had been introduced to the stores. Several stores on mainland Europe were opened the following year. By the end of 1979 Marks and Spencer had opened their first stores in Ireland.\nTheir products were considered as good value for money and their policy of treating all customers with professionalism made M&S a customer favorite. Part of their customer-friendly policies was their returns guarantee which offered customers a full refund on any purchase as long as they could provide a receipt. This policy applied to all clothes and was regardless of the original sale date.\nMarks and Spencer have sold specialty foods for the christmas season since the late 1950 but at some point during the 1970 their customers fell out of love with the sweet dessert offerings by M&S. They hired a food specialist in order to bring the sweet range right back on track which was achieved successfully. In the 1960 the company opened their first outlet in Kabul in Afghanistan. This shop had been closed only a few years later. Marks and Spencer tried to venture into the Canadian market in the 1970. But with a reputation of selling old-fashioned clothes for the elderly people only, the stores did not make any profit. All stores in Canada had been closed by the end of the year 1999.\nIn 2001 Per Una, a clothes collection for women, was launched. 2008 saw the opening of the company's first store in China. The store in Shanghai had a troubled start when food supplies were delayed.\nMarks and Spencer eventually started selling their own-brand perfumes and body care products. Florentyna, a fragrance composed of jasmine, gardenia and musk is one of the bestsellers. Per Una, a casual scent, features notes of magnolia, jasmine, rose, freesia, woods, heliotrope and patchouli.

This position led to a management opportunity at a Nottingham boutique, and eventually to his own boutique, opened in 1970. With the assistance of his girlfriend at the time (and later his wife) Pauline Denyer, then a design student at the Royal College of Art, as well as a few night classes to improve his tailoring skills, he realized his dream of creating his own fashion line. His first menswear collection was shown in Paris in 1976.\nThe success of this line allowed for expansion to a new boutique on Floral Street in Covent Garden. The line went international with the expansion of the business in Japan, where the Paul Smith line is popular. In 1998, Smith converted a town-house in Notting Hill, London into his line's flagship store. Paul Smith showed his first women's collection in 1998 at London Fashion Week. The designer's notoriety is primarily from his background in the menswear industry, but the women's mainline collection continues to this day.\nToday, Paul Smith offers products under the labels Paul Smith, Paul Smith Women, PS by Paul Smith, Paul Smith Jeans, Paul Smith London, R.

			"Penhaligon's is a British perfumery established in 1870 by William Penhaligon. Originating as a barbershop, Penhaligon's offered its first fragrance in 1872, Hammam Bouquet. The fragrance was inspired by the neighboring Turkish Bath and its sulfurous steam. The company's best-selling fragrance, 1902's Blenheim Bouquet, created at the request of the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim Palace, broke with the prevailing floral trends of its day to enchant with zesty citrus, spices and woods.\nScents were issued regularly from the original shop on Jermyn Street, until it was destroyed in The Blitz of 1941. The shop disappeared, but the fragrances of the company endured, and in 1956, Penhaligon's was granted a Royal Warrant by the Duke of Edinburgh for the manufacturing of toiletries.\nInterest in the company was renewed with the opening of a new Penahligon's flagship store in Covent Gardens, in 1975. The flagship store represented a new direction for the company as well, with the old formulas composed by William Penahligon being resurrected, and new floral scents designed to appeal to a modern female customer.

The concept was a success, and The Body Shop expanded at a rate of 50% annually for a number of years. The company\'s stock was first offered for sale in 1984, and in 1989, Roddick purchased full U.S. and Israeli rights to the name "The Body Shop" from the U.S.-based company.\nThe Body Shop placed an early emphasis on products inspired by nature, featuring botanical ingredients of Fair Trade origin. The company and its founder were noted for their social activism. The Body Shop took a stance against animal testing and refuses to use ingredients or sell products that were tested on animals after 1990. They were the first international cosmetics company to be recognized under the Humane Cosmetics Standard for their "Against Animal Testing" policy.\nThe company has used its store space, and its founder used her influence as a leader, to call attention to causes such as Greenpeace and media representation of the female image and its impact on women\'s self-esteem.\nThe Body Shop created its own "fair trade" program called Community Trade, which involves trading with communities in need and giving them a fair price for natural ingredients or handcrafts the company purchases.\nThe Body Shop now has more than 2,500 stores in 60 countries worldwide. It was sold to L\'Oreal in 2006, and founder Anita Roddick\'s untimely death in 2007 made headlines around the world.\nPerfumes have long been a part of The Body Shop\'s offering, and are often accompanied by luxurious body care products in the same scent.\nDesigner The Body Shop has 114 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'Vivienne Westwood is a UK-based fashion designer best known for creating the look of the original punk rock movement in the 1970s.\nWith a background in art, fashion and jewelry, Westwood began life as a primary school teacher who earned money on the side with her original jewelry designs. She met musician and entrepreneur Malcolm McClaren (who would go on to manage such legendary punk and New Wave musicians as the Sex Pistols, New York Dolls and Bow Wow Wow), and the two opened a boutique at 430 Kings Road. Taking inspiration from underground biker and fetish cultures, the shop offered unusual clothing made of leather and rubber, and featuring spikes, chains, safety pins and razor blades as embellishments. The shop\'s name would evolve over time from Let It Rock to Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die and Seditionaries.\nThe shop and its clothing became popular with a rising youth culture that would eventually become known as Punk.\nAs the 1970s came to a close and punk became absorbed in mainstream culture, the shop at 430 Kings Road changed its name to Worlds End, and re-vamped the clothing it sold.\nWestwood\'s designs in the 1980s were varied in their artistic inspiration. An early collection capitalized on the New Romantic movement in fashion and music and offered clothing with a Pirate theme. Later collections in the 1980s, which Westwood has dubbed the "Early Years," were inspired by history, pop culture, cities and third world cultures. Westwood ended her association with Malcolm McClaren in 1983.\nThe designer reinvented herself and her fashions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a period she describes as the "Pagan Years." Tradition British fabrics such as Harris Tweed were featured, and the designs were inspired by historical events and fashions of the past. The remainder of the 1990s are referred to by Westwood as the "Anglomania" years, in which she explored a traditional feminine silhouette, exaggerated by padding and bustles. Historical inspirations continued with a Tudor-inspired line in 1997-1998. The era from 2000 through today is described by Westwood as "Exploration," as she focuses more on the dynamics of the fabric she uses and the cutting and tailoring techniques that create the design.\nVivienne Westwood partners with Coty to offer fragrances under her name. The first perfume, Boudoir, was introduced in 1998. Other fragrances in the collection have borne the name of her boutique (Let It Rock), and the name of a fashion era in her history (Anglomania). The "Alice" collection, including Naughty Alice and Cheeky Alice so far, are the most recent offerings in Westwood\'s line.\nDesigner Vivienne Westwood has 11 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1998 and the newest is from 2014.

Qualia define who we are and how we use all of our senses to interpret the world we live in; a badge of individuality.\nAqualis therefore represents the nature of experience itself. While the senses map our experience of the world, a carefully selected fragrance can acutely dominate and lift ambience, in a tangible yet immeasurable way that we can only experience.\nAqualis founder, Steyn Grobler was raised in South Africa and moved to London when he was fifteen. He started a career in luxury at seventeen as a model. He worked with some of the best photographers and stylists in the world, appearing from GQ to Vogue. Traveling the globe attending fashion weeks from Korea to Milan. At twenty Steyn studied for four years, gaining an MSc in Business. It was during his studies that a part time job in Harrods turned into a managerial role at Boadicea the Victorious. Completely captivated by the world of fragrance, Steyn developed some of the most prolific fragrances at Boadicea the Victorious. After five years at Boadicea the Victorious it was time to follow his dream of expressing his own creativity, and Aqualis was the result.\nThe Evolution range is an expression of significant experiences in Steyn’s life. Growing up in Pretoria, spending time in the Namibian Desert and Brenton on Sea on holidays. Steyn used indigenous oils from the Southern African region to showcase these concepts whilst creating contemporary art work and packaging that gives the consumer an immersive experience.

The official launch of the house was December 22nd 2019 at 4:19am marked by the winter solstice. The movements of the stars and heavens and timing of solstice and equinox were hugely important to nearly all ancient cultures. The house logo is a star, tying in with the celestial bodies and importance of the heavens. It also represents the future of where our civilisation will one day explore new worlds, Proxima Centauri being our nearest star. At the same moment representing past, with that specific star being carved in stone by the ancient Sumerians thousands of years ago. \n\nEvery aspect is done by the owner and perfumer Peter Carter. The conceptual idea behind the house is presented through Past, Present & Future, as three distinct lines within the house. \n\nPast is presented in red, symbolised by fire. One of the most important discoveries of the development of our ancestors. It takes inspiration directly from the mystery of our ancient cultures from around the globe. A homage to where we have come from, focused on using natural materials. \n\nPresent is shown in white, our modern day world, the age of the smart phone and internet. The technological age, and the here and now in the present moment. This line is free to explore inspirations from our current world through the use of mixed media. A balance and harmony of natural oils and modern day aroma chemicals.\n\nFuture is blue, the colour of the sky. Inspired by the heavens and the stars. This line is also mixed media, with a larger emphasis on modern aroma chemicals. This line nods to our longing to expand beyond the Earth, to become a civilisation capable of exploring new worlds. Inspired with the hope of humanity and the evolution of human consciousness.\nThe three lines separated by past, present, future, natural, mixed media to aroma chemical, allow a wider creative pallet to work from. The most luxurious natural oils of the past, to the most modern synthetics of the present and future.

The word perfume is derived from the Latin 'perfumas' meaning 'through smoke' and it was the Romans that refined the art of perfume making, using rare and exotic ingredients from across their vast empire.\nTo the average Roman man and woman, perfume was a necessity not a luxury. Men associated scent with health and bathed in perfumes, perfumed their clothes and even their horses while gladiators applied perfumed lotions before they fought. Wealthy women benefited from handmaidens, ‘Cosmetae’, much prized for their skills, who attended their mistresses and would pour treasured oils into the bath and onto the skin.\nPerfume became a phenomenon as the wealthy and stylish bid to trump their friends and neighbours with more and more complex, costly and rare ingredients and it is estimated that by the first century AD Roman Society was consuming 2500 tons of Frankincense and 500 tons of Myrrh.\nAt Electimuss, fragrance is embraced as an indispensable part of grooming and ingredients, as the name implies, are selected from rarest and finest oils and resins from around the world including truffle, caviar, saffron, lotus flower, Mysore sandalwood and oud. Intensity is a key component of the Electimuss collection and ‘Electimuss Pure Perfume’ is a staggeringly indulgent 30% concentration, the most intoxicating way of experiencing luxury fine fragrance.\nFinally, each bottle bears the ‘Vertragus’, ancestor of the modern greyhound “swifter than thought or a winged bird it runs” (Grattius) - the perfect olfactory metaphor.\nElectimuss is a new fragrance brand.

It translates as: “Elegant people of our time are honorable people who pass on their values to others.” It was after reading this phrase that they felt propelled to enter the world of fragrance and to create a new perfume collection that has at its heart a sense of history, honor, style, elegance, and craftsmanship. This is a collection that centers around the artisan and perfecting every detail, with a focus on skilled handiwork which means everything has the personal touch, right down to the hand-written labels." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Elegantes has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Combining variety in education and the growing-up years of the two brand owners with the 20 years of experience in fragrance creation of perfumer Francois Robert, contemporary collection Jardin Mystique was initiated. It was founded on traditional perfumery roots.\nThe collection was launched with three fragrances embodying Nina and Elisabeth\'s sensibility and styles, created to accentuate freshness, optimism and beauty of greenery, herbs, spices and delicate flowers.\nDesigner Friedemodin has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base.

With his creative thirst ignited, he further immersed himself in the worlds of contemporary art, gentleman’s fashion, minimalist design, and the craft of making natural skincare and beauty products.\nA chance meeting with an industry veteran in 2010 resulted in the idea of creating fragrances using essential oils combined with other natural ingredients. Peter attended courses and met with independent perfumers whilst embarking on his self-taught journey, which simply intensified his desire to develop handcrafted perfumes, using only the finest of ingredients. The result is simple, uniquely sophisticated and chic fragrances, representative of the diverse nature of the city he knows and loves.\nThe name HERBA was chosen for its salute to herbal properties and is representative of the brand\'s ethos; creating a product that is as naturally close to source as possible.\nPeter continues, "I’m seeking the synergy between nature, unusual scents and combining this with traditional craftsmanship. Experimentation is the driving force behind the brand, and only using the highest quality ingredients are the key elements I embrace. As a creator I’m working in the emotional realm as much as the sensory realm, and so scent becomes the bridge between the two. It’s an emotional experience. It’s compelling. And this is what HERBA strives to be."\nExceptional essential and fragrance oils are used to create each of HERBA’s handcrafted products, that draw-out the combinations of every scent, be it bergamot with jasmine and mandarin, or musk with black pepper and saffron. With 8 uniquely sophisticated, traditional and chic fragrances to choose from, HERBA believes there is a scent for every individual and invites you to begin the journey into this emotive world together.\nHERBA London is a new fragrance brand. Designer HERBA London has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2018.',

			"Jo Loves is the newest venture by UK-based fragrance designer Jo Malone. Jo got her start in the fragrance industry as a florist. Her lifelong fondness for all things fragrant began as a child, when she tried to produce her own fragrances using flowers from the family garden and grated soap.\nWorking as a florist by day and a beautician who did facials by night, her business took off when the Nutmeg and Ginger bath oil she produced as a thank-you gift for clients led to requests for re-orders. In 1994, Jo Malone opened her first boutique in London, offering fragrances, skin care, and home scents. A flagship boutique on London's famed Sloane Street was opened in 1999.\nJo was an early advocate for the concept of combining fragrances. Her unisex scents were designed to be worn alone or with other scents in the collection, allowing the wearer to create a custom scent—or a variety of them—by layering the different scents on the skin.\nThe success of Jo Malone caught the eye of a beauty industry giant. Estee Lauder Companies acquired the Jo Malone brand in 1999, and Jo remained with the company as its chairwoman and creative director until 2006. Estee Lauder Companies continues to operate and produce new scents under the Jo Malone brand. With the financial backing of Estee Lauder Companies, the Jo Malone brand has expanded its distribution to numerous countries around the world.\nIn November 2011, designer Jo Malone announced a return to the fragrance industry with the formation of a new brand, Jo Loves, currently available for sale in the UK. During her brief retirement, Jo explored cooking, food and flavors. It wasn't long before she realized the culinary experiments were pushing her in the direction of fragrance-creation once again.\nJo Loves was designed to capture the inspirations in Jo's life—the ingredients, the people and the moments in time.\nThe brand debuted in November 2011 with four fragrances—Pomelo, Green Orange & Coriander, Orange Tulle and Gardenia. The fragrances of the Jo Loves line are distinguished from her former fragrance line by title and by the distinctive red packaging with a simple white logo on a black background.\nDesigner Jo Loves has 18 perfumes in our fragrance base.

As Founder and Perfumer, Marina\'s vision was to be involved in every aspect of the process, from sourcing rare and precious aromatic essences from around the world to blending fragrances by hand in her own perfume studio. With a range of six perfumes and a selection of body oils, bath salts and sugar scrubs, which were originally blended to order, she saw her passion turn into an industry recognised "fragrance house".\nIn 2016 Marina won the coveted Fragrance Foundation (FiFi) Award for Best New Independent Fragrance with India, which prompted her to take the next step on her journey; The Perfume Garden became Marina Barcenilla Parfums. While the name has changed the ethos remains the same...\n"to create the finest fragrances using what nature has to offer".\nMore awards have followed in 2017. Patchouli Clouds Fragrance won the Editor\'s Choice Beauty Shortlist Award, The Perfume Garden fragrance and Patchouli Clouds Bath & Body Oil each won an NHM International Natural Beauty Award, and Marina Barcenilla Parfums won the Eluxe Award for Best Natural Perfume Brand. The Perfume Garden was finalist for the prestigious FiFi Award of Perfume Extraordinaire at the 2017 UK Awards, and both Black Osmanthus and The Perfume Garden were chosen finalists for Best New Independent Fragrance, which Marina won for the second consecutive year with Black Osmanthus.\nMarina\'s decision to use nature-derived ingredients in fragrances which carry the Marina Barcenilla Parfums name stems from a love of the complexity of natural aromas. Born in Spain she remembers being intrigued by the aromatic notes in the Herbissimo fragrances and in her grandmother\'s lavender water, and she says that is where her love of natural ingredients came from. She has always been interested in scent and when the chance came to branch out from her aromatherapy roots into the world of perfume she accepted the challenge. Using ingredients as building blocks for fragrance instead of for their therapeutic qualities came easy to her, and it didn\'t take long before she began to create bespoke fragrances for customers who had heard of her through word of mouth.\nMarina finds beautiful complexity within naturals, which are almost like a perfume in themselves, and her aim is to help people to\n“rediscover the soul of perfume”." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Marina Barcenilla Parfums has 6 perfumes in our fragrance base.

The Quiksilver logo, a cresting wave and snowcapped mountain, is designed by the company founder Alan Green in Torquay, Victoria, Australia in the early 1970s. It was inspired by Japanese artist Hokusai's woodcut “The Great Wave off Kanagawa”. The goal of the company was to create the best possible shorts for surfing. Two American surfers, Robert B. McKnight and Jeffrey Hakman, decided to get the licensing rights for Quiksilver, a six year-old company based in Torquay, Australia. McKnight and Hakman's success with the Quiksilver brand name began in 1976, when Hakman entered a surfing competition in Australia. The first line of apparel was also launched in that year.\nDuring the first decade of business Quiksilver achieved recognition for its swimsuits, boardshorts, surfing clothes and accessories. During the 1980s, the brand expanded its offer with other board wear and began to distribute in department stores, which peaked during the 1990s. In 1990 they launched the Roxy brand for young women. Today, Quiksilver, Inc. produces and distributes casual sportswear, beachwear and snowboard wear, with the main goal of setting fashion trends for surfers, under the following labels: Quiksilver, Roxy, Private Surf, Que, and Raisin. The brand holds offices in Europe, Australia and America.\nIn 2004, Quiksilver founded charity The Quiksilver Foundation. The Quiksilver Foundation is a non-profit organization with the goal to benefit and enhance the quality of life for communities of boardriders across the world by supporting environmental, educational, health and youth-related projects. From its office at Quiksilver's Headquarters in Huntington Beach, California, the Quiksilver Foundation coordinates with the company's global offices in Asia, Australia, Europe and world-wide.\nQuiksilver fragrance for men was presented in 2008 under the license of Inter Parfums.\nQuiksilver is a new fragrance brand.

When the artists take over the laboratory it means they can make the things they want to make with no focus groups to keep things boring.\nThey can get on with mixing up challenging, beautiful works of their olfactory imaginations. They can use a high proportion of the natural materials that are priced out of most commercial scents nowadays.\nThey can get totally out of control with the design of the bottles. A fridge magnet mascot of each renegade’s avatar appears on the fragrance he made. Whether he has Colt pistols for ears or is pictured with a Stetson mutating into a peyote cactus – these gunslingers are a long way from your average bottle design.

			'"Sarah Baker is a London-based artist whose body of work spans performance, photography, moving image, collage, sculpture, and scent. Her works feature exceptional and unlikely characters such as a male synchronized swimmer, a Native American street performer, a fashion mogul murderess, and the late feminist airport-tycoon novelist, Jackie Collins. Baker also performs in her pieces, re-enacting forms of spectacle as seen on television, in tabloids and other news media.\nBaker’s work considers the mystique of luxury products and how branding and subsequent value is created through the highly fictive practices of advertising and marketing. Her media include magazine spreads, performance, sculpture and video and look to articulate a discourse on systems of display and the value placed on consumer brands through the cult of celebrity, fashion and design.\nCurrent projects include the launch of Sarah Baker Perfumes, an extension of Baker’s artistic practice where scents emerge as characters from an extravagant world. Baker has been invited to serve as a judge for the 2018 Art and Olfaction Awards in London. Baker is also working on a multimedia project with Baron Magazine, London." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Sarah Baker Perfumes has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Founder of the perfume house, Tonya Kidd-Beggs, curated each blend personally as a testament to the power of fragrance in her own life. Grasse, on the French Riviera, has a long established fragrance history dating back to the 17th century. It was here that Tonya developed her scents, under the guidance of her perfumer, using only the finest raw materials sourced from all over the world. Tonya employed time-honoured, traditional methods to formulate the fragrances while trusting her intuition to bring balance to the collection. Tonya’s intention is to use fragrance to tell her story, a story to which the wearer can relate, in the hope of empowering people to connect with fragrance and share the stories that emerge. STORIES by Eliza Grace is more than a range of luxurious beauty products, it is an homily on transformation.\nThe brand\'s philosophy: To awaken the senses: The notes and undertones in the perfumes are delicately balanced and complex. Each scent reflects a part of the brand’s story while encouraging the wearer to connect with their own nostalgia. The products are designed to inspire the redolence of memories. To pamper the body: The entire range of STORIES by Eliza Grace is hand-crafted. The Eau de Parfums were created in such a way that each note is discernible as it develops on the skin. The body care range matches the fragrances and features luxurious ingredients with proven health benefits such as: aloe vera, shea butter, marula seed oil, argan kernal oil and coconut oil, to name a few. To be gender-inclusive and unique: The bespoke blend of aromas in each fragrance defies gender barriers. The high-quality ingredients and traditional production make it a truly niche product available exclusively to high-end retailers.

			'Adidas is a German athletic shoe and apparel brand founded in 1948 by Adolph "Adi" Dassler. The company name is a actually a hybrid of "Adi" and "Dassler," though it also is popularly known as an acronym for "All Day I Dream About Sport."\nThe company\'s distinct three-bar logo which adorns most of their apparel and merchandise was originally used by a Finnish apparel company called Karhu Sports. Adidas bought the logo from Karhu in 1951.\nAdolph Dassler\'s interest in athletic footwear production began with his return from World War I. The Dassler Brothers began manufacturing shoes from their mother\'s laundry business. The shoes were first used in an Olympics event in 1928, and were the first athletic shoes to feature studs and spikes. Women\'s 800M competitor Lina Radke-Batschauer was the first athlete to win a gold medal in the shoes. In 1936, the Dassler brothers drove samples to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, where they persuaded American athlete Jesse Owens to try to the shoes. This represented, in essence, the first athletic sponsorship of an African-American athlete. Owens\' four gold medals from the 1936 Olympics greatly improved the company\'s reputation, and athletes around the world were requesting a pair of the Dassler Brothers shoes.\nThe Dassler brothers had a falling out after World War II . Adolph and Rudolf dissolved the Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory and parted ways, each going on to form rival shoe companies. Brother Rudolf founded athletic shoe company Puma, also based in Herzogenaurach, where Adolph Dassler registered Adidas as a company in 1949.\nAdidas\' reputation as a shoe manufacturer expanded over the years as the company shod winning athletes and several winning sports teams in notable victories, such as Germany\'s 1954 World Cup victory over Hungary, known today as the "Miracle of Bern." This game was the first in which the players wore football shoes with removable studs. The company began producing shoes not just for track and field or football, but tennis, golf, boxing boots for Muhammad Ali, and footwear for other sports. The company even produced an early "shower shoe" at the request of athletes who wanted a rubber slip-on to wear in the locker room. Some of the companies most enduring styles—the Samba, the Adilette, the Superstar—have been in production for 40 years or more.\nAdidas began producing athletic apparel in 1960 and added athletic equipment such as footballs to its offerings in 1963. Since 1970, the official ball at all important football events has been an Adidas-branded ball.\nFounder Adolph Dassler passed away in 1978, but the company continued under the leadership of his wife Käthe and son Horst. Horst passed away unexpectedly in 1987. Adidas AG officially became a corporation in 1989 and that same year, the company was bought by French businessman Bernard Tapie. It was later sold to Robert Louis-Dreyfus in 1993. Under the leadership of Dreyfus, Adidas expanded with the acquisition and sell-off of multiple sports and athletic companies. Adidas acquired the Reebok brand in 2006. Today, Adidas AG offers products under the Adidas, Reebook, Taylor-Made Adidas Golf Comapny and Rockport brands.\nAdidas partnered with Coty in 1985 to produce a line of fragrances. They have achieved particular success in the male market, and fragrances and body care products are marketed under the Adidas brand in more than 82 countries today. The fragrances for men and women often feature a sporty name and bottle design.\nDesigner Adidas has 71 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Almodóvar cast the young actor—then just 22 years of age—in his debut film, "Laberinto de Pasiones" ("Labyrinth of Passion").

He achieved great success in the film series "Spy Kids" with director Robert Rodriguez.

Originally a chain of just two stores that offered safari and travel-themed clothing, the majority of its sales were generated by its eccentric, hand-illustrated catalog, which presented high-end and unique items with conversational backstories from exotic locations, as well as more common high-volume products deliberately spiced up with a similar treatment. At that time, Banana Republic was known for the safari-themed decor of its stores, often featuring authentic elements, such as real Jeeps, plants and trees, as well as atmospheric elements, such as fog and steam.\nThe Gap, Inc. acquired Banana Republic in 1983. Banana Republic's image and product lines were subsequently made over to become the upscale apparel store known by consumers today. The Gap, Inc. then launched Old Navy in 1994, to cover the lower-priced end of the retail clothing market. Shoe retailer Piperlime was created in 2006, and the company rounded out its offerings with Athleta, an athletic apparel retailer for women, which they acquired in 2009.\nToday, The Gap, Inc. has more than 3,100 stores worldwide.

As a child she attended dance classes and even today her passion for dance and costumes dominate in her creations.\nIn 1964 she officially entered the fashion world by winning the Mademoiselle “Guest Editor Contest”. A year later she became the main designer of the Paraphernalia boutique, well known for the creations of young London creators among which Mary Quant and Paco Rabanne. Very soon she became famous for her creations of sexy silhouette models and floral hippy designs. In 1969 Betsey Johnson opened her own boutique, Betsey Bunki Nini.\nIn 1970’s she took control of the Alley Cat label, popular among rock’n roll musicians. The 70’s were significant for Betsey because she won the Coty award as the youngest designer ever awarded. 1978 brings a shift in her career due to the partnership with Chantal Bacon. They started the Betsey Johnson label as known today.\nIn 1980’s she opened a store in LA Melrose Avenue, and in 1999 she started her store in Vancouver. In 2006 she opened her first store in Tokyo. Her creations can also be found in specialized stores in Asia and Europe.\nIn 2003 Betsey decided to move to Mexico with her family. She bought a small hotel, renovated it and named it Betseyville. She decided to rent it to the public, to interesting people as she says, and she stays there when she needs a dose of inspiration for her creations.\nIn her private life, she had difficult moments, and she is a breast cancer survivor. She is therefore known for her participation in many campaigns for fight and prevention of this disease. In 2003 CFDA asked her to be an Honorary Chairperson for the “Fashion Targets Breast Cancer” what she accepted. Because of her work and dedication to the fight against breast cancer she was also awarded by the National Breast Cancer Coalition in 2004, at a prestigious ceremony hosted by Ron Perlman .\nThe New Millennium opened many new opportunities for her business. Beside clothes she started designing shoes and underwear. She also follows the new trends and her boutiques offer accessories, purses, glasses, belts, watches, jewelry, swimming suits, and of course, the unavoidable – fragrances.\nIn 2006 she launches her first fragrance, Betsey Johnson, a real pop art luxury. The outer package is decorated with the details which reflect her style, leopard print and roses, while the bottle is accentuated with a very unusual and attention drawing top. The unusual bottle was designed by Colorful Licences.\nBetsey Johnson fragrance was created by two noses, Bernard Blanc and Mathilde Bijaoui. They gave it a sparkling and joyful opening, combining the notes of grapefruit, pear, black currant and tangerine. The middle notes unite the floral and fruity accords of freesia, lily of the valley and red apple, while the base bring cedarwood, sandalwood, praline, amber and musks.\nThe fragrance comes as EDP in 30ml (1oz), 50ml (1.7oz) and 100ml (3.4oz), with the matching body care products, perfumed bath, shower gel and body lotion in 200ml sizes.\nBetsey Johnson is known as a capricious, but feminine woman, full of energy, which persistently follows her own way and her love for fashion, details and life in general. She has a daughter Lulu, born in 1975, together with whom she works today and makes many new and interesting creations.\nBetsey Johnson says about herself: “Making clothes involves what I like…color, pattern, shape and movement…I like the everyday process…the people, the pressure, the surprise of seeing the work come alive walking and dancing around on strangers. Like red lipstick on the mouth, my products wake up and brighten and bring the wearer to life…drawing attention to her beauty and specialness…her moods and movements…her dreams and fantasies.”\nDesigner Betsey Johnson has 4 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Dion's career began at the tender age of 12 and she has grown from a child star to an international adult pop star before the world's eyes.\nDion was born in the small town of Charlemagne, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada), and was the youngest of 14 children. Both parents were musicians and music was important to the family. Her parents operated a small club and the entire family performed and entertained the local population on weekends. Dion's career as an entertainer began at the tender age of five, and by age twelve, together with her mother and one of her brothers, Celine composed a song which would change the course of her life.\nA demo tape containing the song was brought to the attention of René Angélil, a well respected personal manager who would later become Dion's husband. Recognizing a star in the making with an incredible voice, Angélil mortgaged his house to finance the recording of Celine Dion's debut album. Dion would go on to win the 1982 Gold Medal at the Yamaha World Song Festival in Tokyo, along with the coveted Musician's Award for Top Performer. In 1983, she became the first Canadian ever to receive a Gold Record in France. By 1988, she had established a successful career as a French-language singer, but it was 1990's breakthrough album in English, \"Unison,\" with its Top 5 single \"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\" that put her on the map for international stardom.\nHer 1992 recording of the theme song to Disney film \"Beauty and the Beast,\" a duet with Peabo Bryson, won the Academy Award for Best Performance by a Duo or Pop Group.

Inspired by a Vogue magazine article in which a dermatologist discussed the importance of skin care, Evelyn Lauder shared the article with her mother-in-law, Estee, and also reached out to the beauty editor and dermatologist who participated in the article. The Clinique line was developed with their input, and made its debut in August 1968 at Saks Fifth Avenue.\nThe company\'s products were the first cosmetics line to be allergy-tested and dermatologist driven. Today, the products are 100% fragrance-free. All products in the line go through extensive testing are held to rigorous standards regarding allergic reactions.\nThe name "Clinique" is French for "clinical," and the clinical and dermatological image of the brand is further enhanced by the trademarked white lab coats worn by its sales associates. Clinique\'s approach is based on the cleanliness and hygiene of the skin, and its 3-step skincare systems for a variety skin types are one of its most notable products.\nClinique also markets cosmetics and fragrances as part of its line. The first Clinique fragrance, Aromatics Elixir, was introduced in 1971. This distinct fragrance which just celebrated its 40th anniversary has been a signature scent for multiple generations of women. In spite of the enduring popularity of Aromatics Elixir, the company\'s best-selling fragrance is actually Happy, introduced in 1997.\nThis zesty citrus-floral scent bounced into the national consciousness through a series of lively television ads featuring the Judy Garland song, "Come on Get Happy," which was said to have inspired its name. The name, the advertising and the fragrance struck a chord with American women of the late 20th century.

		title: "Coach",
		description:
			"Coach is an American leather goods company created in 1941 in Manhattan, New York. A group of six leather artisans founded the original business, first named Gail Manufacturing Company. In 1946, Miles and Lillian Cahn joined the company. Already experienced in leather goods and handbag manufacturing, and with a good business sense, the Cahns would steer the company in the direction that would help it become one of the most popular American handbag designers.\nMiles Cahn took over the Gail Manufacturing Company by 1950. The wallets and small leather goods produced by the company were profitable, but Cahn's interest in new technology and materials helped the business expand into production of women's handbags. In 1961, the Gail Leather Products, Inc. brand was born. The handbags produced by this company bridged the gap between the high-dollar designer pieces and the inexpensive, poor-quality knock-offs that comprised the women's handbag market of the day. Coach used quality cowhide and developed a process that made it both soft and durable, and when designer Bonnie Cashin was brought on board in 1962, the demand for the company's handbags soared.\nThe collaboration with Cashin lasted until 1974, and her use of color, hardware, pockets and other features revolutionized the company's line. The company also began producing small accessories such as pens and key chains, and expanded into shoes under her direction. In the mid-1970s, Gail Leather Products, Inc. changed its name to Coach Products, Inc.\nCoach began offering its products via mail order, and eventually expanded into department stores, specialty stores and partnerships with selected vendors.\nIn 1980, the company changed its name again to Coach Leatherware Company, and in 1985, the company was sold to American food manufacturer Sara Lee Corporation.\nUnder Sara Lee, the Coach brand opened specialty boutiques outside New York and was offering its products through department stores, effectively expanding across America into the company that is recognized today.\nCoach was sold by Sara Lee and became a publicly-traded corporation in 2000. Today, there are more than 500 Coach stores in the United States and Canada, and a wholly-owned subisidiary focused on the Japanese market, Coach Japan. Coach is also widely distributed in department stores across the United States and is available in more than 200 stores outside the U.S. market. The company's headquarters remain in Manhattan, and the Coach offering has expanded to include clothing, shoes, eyewear, luggage, non-leather accessories and fragrance.\nThe first fragrance from Coach, eponymous women's scent Coach, was launched in 2007. Coach fragrances today are offered in conjunction with Estee Lauder Companies.\nDesigner Coach has 30 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2007 and the newest is from 2020.

			"Coty, Inc. is a beauty brand founded François Coty in 1904. Born Joseph Marie François Spoturno, a native of Corsica, he moved to Paris and adopted the more French-sounding name of François Coty, with \"Coty\" a variation of his mother's maiden name. Initially a secretary, he studied perfumery under a local pharmacist and begin what he hoped would be a revolution in the fragrance industry, which had changed little since the 19th century.\nCoty's first fragrance, La Rose Jaqueminot, was introduced in 1904, and made Coty a millionaire. Coty's genius would prove not only to be perfume crafting, but in marketing fragrances as well. A famous quote by Monsieur Coty: \"Give a woman the best product to be made, market it in the perfect flask, beautiful in its simplicity yet impeccable in its taste, ask a reasonable price for it, and you will witness the birth of a business the size of which the world has never seen.\"\nLa Rose Jacqueminot was packaged in a beautiful Baccarat bottle. Coty recognized the importance of offering a beautiful, luxurious product such as perfume in an equally beautiful and luxurious package. Coty partnered with ceramic artist and jeweler Rene Lalique, who designed ornate bottles and gilded labels, in the Art Nouveau style, for early Coty creations such as L'Origan.\nCoty was one of the first companies to attempt to market perfume, which had always been seen as a luxury product for the wealthy, to middle class and working class women, in smaller and plainer bottles. The strategy was a huge success, and Coty helped make perfume the international mass-market product it eventually became.\nCoty acquired factory space and was able to control the entire means of perfume production, on a massive scale. Cosmetics were added to the Coty offering, and its Air Spun powder is still produced today.\nA notable Coty creation which spawned an entire fragrance family was 1917's Chypre, the French name for the island of Cyprus. Chypre's innovative blend of oakmoss, labdanum and bergamot was one of his best-selling scents, and inspired many other fragrances from other companies that continue to be best-sellers today, such as Guerlain's Mitsouko.\nCoty opened an American division after World War I, with other subsidiaries opened in the U.K. and Romania. An acrimonious divorce and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 greatly reduced his fortune. François Coty passed away in 1934, and his ex-wife Yvonne sold Coty to pharmaceutical company Pfizer in 1963. The sale prompted a shift to the almost exclusive marketing of Coty fragrances through drug stores and mass retailers until the early 1990s. The company changed hands again in 1992 and came under the ownership of Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH. A change in strategy at that time has kept the Coty name in the top tier of the fragrance industry. Coty operates under two divisions today: Coty Beauty and Coty Prestige, offering fragrances at every price point through almost 40 separate brands.\nDesigner Coty has 99 perfumes in our fragrance base. Coty is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1905 and the newest is from 2014. Coty fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Philippe Roques, Christophe Raynaud, Vincent Roubert, Francois Coty, Jean-Pierre Weil, Sophia Grojsman, Bernard Chant, Ann Gottlieb, Carlos Benaim, Henri Robert, Harry Fremont and Coty.",

The company's symbol is the Crab Apple Tree (Pyrus malus), a tree native to Britain and the botanical progenitor to all varieties of apples cultivated today.\nCyrus Harvey founded the company in 1972 as a small family business in Cambridge, MA (USA) offering luxury soaps from around the world. The botanical beauty industry was a new concept at that time, and the company's products expanded to include personal care products featuring the finest botanical essences and aromas. In 1977, the first Crabtree & Evelyn boutique was opened in Philadelphia.\nCrabtree & Evelyn's company mission is to create products and gifts that transform the ordinary rituals of daily life into extraordinary pleasurable experiences. To that end, the company offers bath and body care products for men and women, as well as perfumes, home fragrances and home accessories for kitchen and bath. The company commissioned the creation of a rose—the Evelyn Rose—to be used in its products. English rose expert David Austin spent eight years and went through 30,000 seedlings before the perfect rose was achieved. The Evelyn Rose is a lovely apricot-blend rose with a beautiful blossom and a luscious scent. The Evelyn Rose is used in Crabtree & Evelyn's signature \"Evelyn Rose\" fragrance and body care line, where it is combined subtle green accords, peony and a hint of peach.\nMany Crabtree & Evelyn fragrances are based on classical floral notes, such as Lavender, Rosewater and Iris.

Beene was born in the Haynesville in Louisiana, USA, in 1924.\nBeene's first career choice was to become a doctor and so he started to study medicine at New Orleans' Tulane University. When he realized that he wanted to be a fashion designer he left university in 1946 and moved to New York the following year. He took up fashion design at a local college and, after finishing his studies successfully, he went on to work for several fashion houses in New York and in Paris, France.\nWhen he felt that he had gathered enough experience he set up his own business, Geoffrey Beene, Inc., in Manhattan, New York. His company was located on Seventh Avenue (also dubbed Fashion Avenue) and featured a design showroom that soon attracted New Yorkers from all ways of life. Only one year after the company was founded, one of Beene's designs featured on the cover of VOGUE fashion magazine. Some of his most prominent customers were the well known actresses Glenn Close and Faye Dunaway, and Nancy Reagan, the US's first lady from 1981 to 1989. His collections were inspired by timeless and futuristic designs that he reworked into fashionable creations. The first fragrance under the Geoffrey Beene umbrella, Grey Flannel for men, was presented in 1975. For those who could not afford the label's clothes, the fragrance was their chance \"to own a Beene\". Another fragrance, Bowling Green, was presented in 1986.\nBut Beene was not only a fashion designer, but a mentor to young designers, i.e. Alber Elbaz, Doo Ri Chung and Kay Unger, who all went on to become successful fashion designers.\nAfter his death in 2004 the Council of Fashion Designers of America honored his legacy by creating the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award. The brand Geoffrey Beene, now an LLC, has successfully managed to stay in business despite Beene's passing. The Geoffrey Beene LLC has set up two foundations and supports several charitable organisations. In fact, 100% of the company's net profits, gained from the sales of shirts, suits, ties, eyewear, wallets, jewellery, luggage, hats, scarves, belts and other clothing garments and accessories are donated for causes.\nDesigner Geoffrey Beene has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Originally a hotelier by trade, Hayman relocated to California and opened a ritzy and eclectic boutique. His goal was to put Beverly Hills and specifically Rodeo Drive on the map as a world-class luxury shopping and lifestyle destination. Located at the corner of Rodeo Drive and Dayton way, Giorgio Beverly Hills offered a large selection of designer clothes, many of which were exclusive to the boutique. The shop was known for its club-like atmosphere and unusual decor, and it also featured a reading room, a billiards room and a full oak bar. Celebrities and wealthy Californians both shopped and hung out at the trendy location whose entrance was capped by a distinctive yellow and white striped awning.\nThe Giorgio Beverly Hills fragrance was launched in 1981 by Fred Hayman and then-wife Gale Hayman with a fanfare normally reserved for a major perfume house launch, and never before seen for an independent boutique brand. Love it or hate it, the fragrance captured the public's imagination in the 1980s, and was perfectly suited to the era's glamorous and over-the-top fashions. Giorgio Beverly Hills was one of the first scents to be marketed via the new technology of scent strips, which enabled sales by direct mail.\nIn 1987, the Giorgio Beverly Hills fragrance was sold to Avon for an astounding $165 million, and the boutique subsequently changed its name to Fred Hayman Beverly Hills.\nAdditional fragrances were produced under the Giorgio Beverly Hills label, but the original fragrance, with its intense floral notes, remains the most popular. Still in production today, the scent recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. The license-holder for Giorgio Beverly Hills fragrances today is Elizabeth Arden.\nDesigner Giorgio Beverly Hills has 24 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Pooling their common interests, they created the fashion brand “Jacomo” (taking the "Ja" from James, the "Co" from Courtin, and the "Mo" being added to give the name a musical touch) and opened a boutique where they offered their designs to the chic trendsetters of New York.\nTheir first fragrance launch, Eau Cendrée for men, was launched in 1970, in a distinct geometric package, to great success. Eau Cendrée\'s female companion, Chicane, was launched just one year later.\nFragrances become the brand\'s main stock in trade after the success of 1972\'s classic female scent, Silences (still in production today), in the distinctive round black bottle. The company would eventually purchase production facilities in Deauville.

She achieved great success, but after the last man she trained was promoted above her and paid twice her salary, she resigned in frustration. She initially planned to write a book to help women in the direct sales industry overcome obstacles to success. Her work for the book led to the realization that what she was actually creating was a visionary business plan for a new company.\nWith just $5,000, her extensive business knowledge and the help of her son Richard, Mary Kay launched her cosmetics company.

In 1960, he moved to Paris and worked as a couture assistant at Lanvin.\nAfter working in the glamorous world of haute couture for several years, Oscar's business sense led him in the direction of ready-to-wear.

The house experienced immediate success, and Oscar won the 1967 and 1968 Coty American Fashion Critics' Awards.

The candles sold well instantly and soon became the foundation that Pacifica's fragrance empire would be built on. Brook and Billy managed to raise the profile of their brand without any marketing, but with the help of good old-fashioned word-of-mouth. The initial fan-base centred around fragrance lovers and collectors and people who were convinced by the natural perfume line and Brook's personal style of creating fragrances.\nThe scents of the collection are all unique, happy, fun and easy to wear, state the creative heads behind the brand. The use of natural ingredients and sustainable materials and the safety of the products have convinced perfume lovers around the world. Today, Pacifica's collection includes not only fragrances. The product portfolio consists of body washes and butters, scrubs and soaps, candles and even a make-up line.\nPacifica has launched several unisex fragrances that are easy to wear. One of them, Brazilian Mango Grapefruit, is a fruity scent full of mango and grapefruit freshness. Madagaskar Spice is a composition that is built around spicy notes, clove and citruses. Spanish Amber, a scent with dominant notes of resins, is a warm, sweet and classy composition.\nThe main branch of the business is the sale of women's fragrances. French Lilac is a realistic soliflore. Lotus Garden is a light, green, floral and aquatic scent that has delighted many a woman. Persian Rose is a modern interpretation of a rose soliflore.\nDesigner Pacifica has 42 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2007 and the newest is from 2020.

			"Donald and Gun Bauchner founded The Perfumer's Workshop in 1971 with the aim of opening a personalized perfume boutique. When the fragrance Tea Rose was presented in 1977 it became an instant success and today most of their products are distributed throughout the world. The brand's products are still manufactured in the US.\nThe company made a name for themselves when they managed to acquire a concession within Bloomingdale's stores. They sold perfume oils which were a hippie signature then, but reworked the idea behind them to be more in line with Bloomingdale's upmarket concept. The idea of custom-made fragrances was born and Perfumer's Workshop counters opened at Selfridge's (1973) and Harrods (1974) in London. The first counter to open in Paris was the one in Galéries Lafayettes in 1975.\nFor the first time the customer was given the power to make their own decisions about the products they would like to be offered. Ingredients, perfume notes and accords, bottles and packaging were for the customer to choose.\nBy the end of the 1970 the Perfumer's Workshop had developed their product portfolio into a collection of ready-made fragrances that were sold at perfume counters in the whole of the USA. Tea Rose, a favorite since the the end of the 1970s, was or is worn by many famous women. Among them are or were Princess Diana, Grace Kelly, Catherine Deneuve, Nicole Kidman and others. The iconic fragrance was composed around a variety of notes. Among them are bergamot, rose, lily, tuberose, sandalwood and amber. By the end of 2011 more than 50 million bottles this fragrance have been sold.\nThe Samba collection was launched in 1987 and made it into Bloomingdale's outlets the same year. This line became popular and more and more fragrances were launched as part of this collection.\nSince the opening of the brand's Paris office in the 1990s, Perfumer's Workshop have created fragrances for Sonia Rykiel, L'Or de Torrente, Jean-Luc Amsler and Louis Ferraud.\nPerfumer's Workshop fragrances can be found in shops and stores in more than 90 countries. The company's first www-only collection, Zipped, was presented in 2011. This collection is available for test and purchase only and underlines the changing consumer habits. While department stores and boutiques were the favorites in the past, many customers now prefer shopping online.\nDesigner Perfumer's Workshop has 59 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Earning a master's degree in retailing from New York University, he returned to Virginia to work as a buyer and merchandiser, and eventually co-founded his own retail store. A move back to New York to join a sportswear company eventually led to an opportunity to design a womenswear collection. Although Ellis could not sketch, his experience with clothing and the fashion industry enabled him to create one of the most successful sportswear lines of the 1970s, culminating with the introduction of his own brand in 1978.\nThe Perry Ellis line expanded over time to include menswear, accessories, shoes and perfume. The first Perry Ellis fragrances, Perry Ellis for Women and Perry Ellis for Men, debuted in 1985.\nAfter the death of Ellis, a series of notable designers including Isaac Mizrahi, Marc Jacobs and Tom Ford have worked for the company.

This product was successfully marketed to department stores and drugstores, and the company experienced rapid growth as purveyors of manicure tools. They entered the cosmetics world with the addition of lipstick to their offerings in 1940.\nThe company's stock went public in 1955, and by the 1960s Revlon was offering products to different segments of the market under brand names Revlon, Princess Marcella Borghese, Ultima II, Natural Wonder, Moon Drops and Etherea.\nMarketed internationally since the late 1950s, Revlon successfully sold the \"American look\" to other countries through the use of top models—a strategy still in use by Revlon today.\nFragrances have long been included in the Revlon offering, beginning with Jean Nate in 1935.

			"Thomas Carlyle Ford, better known today as Tom Ford, is an American fashion designer and film director. Initially trained as an architect at Parsons School of Design, Ford spent a year working abroad at an internship for fashion house Chloé and developed a feel for the fashion industry.\nFord concealed his architecture background and displayed considerable personal charm in his pursuit of a job in the fashion industry. His first position was with American designer Cathy Hardwick. He accepted a position with Perry Ellis, but knew better prospects were available in Europe. Prestigious Italian fashion house Gucci was struggling at the time, and Ford accepted a position in Gucci's women's Ready-to-Wear division in 1990. Ford achieved considerable success at Gucci, eventually heading up multiple divisions before being named Creative Director in 1992. Ford's efforts were pivotal in Gucci's turn-around. The company was nearly bankrupt when Ford joined the organization, but when he left in 2004, the company's value had more than doubled. During Ford's tenure with Gucci, the company acquired Yves Saint Laurent, and Ford created provocative, controversial and highly successful ad campagins for YSL fragrances Opium and M7. These ads were an early indicator of Ford's future direction.\nTom Ford returned to the U.S. and announced the creation of his own brand in 2005. The company offers fashions, accessories and eyewear, and is known for its sexually-charged advertising. Ford also formed a partnership with Estee Lauder that same year, for the development of fragrances and cosmetics. The first fragrance produced under this alliance, Black Orchid (2006) was an immediate success. A series of successful fragrances for men and women have since been launched, along with a prestige line, Tom Ford Private Blend, whose first fragrance was Purple Patchouli in 2007.\nFord's career took an unusual turn in 2009 when he directed his first film, \"A Single Man,\" which was well-received by critics and filmgoers and earned a number of awards and nominations for the director and actors.\nDesigner Tom Ford has 99 perfumes in our fragrance base.

The husband and wife company founders considered the decades-old traditional approach by the leading perfume conglomerates to be stagnant and withering, and therefore set out to challenge the conventional wisdom of today’s fragrance industry by carefully crafting a luxury brand with a new story for today’s millennial.\n\nA. N. OTHER is developed by a handpicked group of world-renowned perfumers, whose excellence has been harnessed to create a line that reflects their own unique character and personality. Each individual was given a blank canvas and unlimited budget to curate their own signature scent that is uncompromising in quality, using the very best ethically sourced raw ingredients and materials from Gold Standard certified manufacturers. The result is a gender-neutral Parfum grade portfolio of four unique fragrances that pays tribute to creative freedom – each capturing a moment in time – encouraging the wearer to write their own personal story through memories the A. N. OTHER scents bestow. \n \nThe esteemed group of perfumers assembled for the startup venture, considered to be the first of its kind and unprecedented for the fragrance industry, include David Apel – creator of Bond no. 9 Wall Street and Tom Ford Black Orchid; Nathalie Benareau – creator of Phlur Hanami and Olmsted & Vaux; Carlos Viñals – creator of Christian Dior Higher Energy and Patricia Bilodeau – creator of Jo Malone Red Roses.\n“Fragrance is an emotional product and our goal is to connect with our customers on the deepest emotional level, touching upon values, lifestyle and events that are close to them,” says Gilad Amozeg, co-founder of   A. N. OTHER. “Scent can unlock memories and transport us back in time. We like to think of our portfolio of fragrances as “placeholders” that capture youth, optimism, vibrancy, and energy. Our signature line abolishes the norms of today’s perfume industry by ensuring optimum quality in both product manufacturing and package presentation through our chosen suppliers based in Florida. Our Best In Class standard of service excellence will never outsource production to Asia like most manufacturers. Instead, we insist on going the extra mile for the customer with double the expenditure for our line to be made in the USA, without passing this added cost on to the consumer. We are resolute in offering an uncompromising portfolio at an affordable price that focuses on sustainability and ethically sourced raw ingredients and materials. Each fragrance in our collection reflects an extravagance that would typically carry an exorbitant price tag. Our moral compass has given us the guidance to strip away the unnecessary expense for licensing, distribution and celebrity endorsements, allowing us to produce a world-class product that can be sold for less.”\n \n“A. N. OTHER” reflects the brand essence of the newly formed collection – a placeholder or pseudonym used by an identity, person or contributor wishing to remain anonymous – as a name that is yet to be decided. The brand identity allows for the portfolio to evolve each year, introducing a series of newly formed scents created by a new group of revered perfumers, each with a different story to tell." - a note from the brand.\nA.

			'Andy Warhol, was an American painter, printmaker and filmmaker famous for being a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. He was born as Andrew Warhola in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Andy Warhol Museum exists in memory of his life and artwork in his hometown.\nHis first steps in the career were those of a commercial illustrator in the beginning of the 1960s, but what brought him worldwide fame was for his work as a painter, avant-garde filmmaker, record producer, author, and member of highly diverse social circles.\nWarhol’s art inspired numerous retrospective exhibitions, books and documentary films. One of his most widely known expressions was "15 minutes of fame." His works are very high priced and held in high esteem today. His painting that achieved the highest price is 1963 canvas titled Eight Elvises - $100 million!\nWarhol left his mark on various media – painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker.\nPop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting. One of them was Warhol and he even got the nickname "Pope of Pop". In this new style he focused on popular subjects or persons and interpreted them in his way. He started with images taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. His great success was a display of pop art paintings in1961, as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller\'s window display. His painting became more and more simplified and they depicted brand names, celebrities, dollar signs – without clear traces of the artist\'s "hand".\nWarhol’s first major exhibition included art works that featured his famous cans of Campbell\'s Soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. Cans and dollar bills became his main subject matter.\nAnother popular subject of his imagery were celebrities. His primary concern was however not working on a signature subject matter, but working on a signature style, which was developing further. The painter liked to use silk-screening; making different versions and variations.\nBetween 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films and about 500 short black-and-white "screen test" portraits. He also created his famous series of static films including Kiss, Eat, and Sleep.\nProduction of Andy Warhol fragrances started in 1999 and several fragrances created in collaboration with famous perfumers have been launched since.\nDesigner Andy Warhol has 7 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1999 and the newest is from 2005.

		description:
			'Miriam Mirani, founder of the house of Aqaba was born to parents originating from Eastern Europe and Mediterranean. At the age of 20, after completing her music studies at the conservatories of the United States and Europe, she decided to travel around the Middle East. She traveled with Bedouins through desert oasis of Sinai and the Nile Delta. At the Red Sea she got acquainted with the ancient Semitic civilizations and discovered the city of Aqaba right in the middle of this cradle of civilization.\nSpending some time there, Miriam Mirani discovered Berbers in Marrakech and Fez and their ancient traditions, and was learning about the traditional art of Arabian perfumery. In 1993 Miriam Mirani returned to Aqaba and some months later, using her perfumery art she embodied her fascination with Aqaba and the story of the legendary love between King Solomon and Queen of Sheba in a fragrance that unites the ancient, traditional and modern. The fragrance she named Aqaba.\nAqaba, the ancient jeweled city on the coast of the Red Sea, is known as a point on the ancient caravan trade route for perfume oils and spices. Aqaba was the place where the Queen of Sheba landed when traveling in a ship built for her by King Solomon, on her way to visit the wise King.\nLeaving no soul indifferent, Aqaba also inspired Miriam Mirani, who paid tribute to the legendary love between the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon by creating a collection of five fragrances which symbolize and represent the awakening of eternal love and eternal spring: Aqaba Classic, Aqaba Spring, and the "Jewels of Aqaba" trilogy—Sands of Aqaba, Midnight Sun and Jewels of Blu.\nIn order to capture and pass on the beauty of Aqaba through fragrance, Miriam Mirani has created this beautiful collection. AQABA is the tribute to the legendary love of Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. AQABA Spring is the re-birth of this love and the Eternal Spring. From the Eternal Spring and Eternal Love, we have the Four Components of Love (according to Miriam Mirani…), the first of which is NATURE. In NATURE you have the SUN, the SAND and the Blu SEA: therefore, Midnight Sun, Sands of Aqaba and Jewels of Blu. Aqaba is located on the tip of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba.\nThree thousands years ago a beautiful black queen traveled over the Sahara desert towards Jerusalem. According to the legend, thirsting for truth and wisdom she was heading to visit the wise king as she had heard of his great wisdom. She did not travel alone; her retinue included numerous attendants in a caravan of camels and mules laden with vast riches – gold, precious stones, oils, spices… Her route took her across the Red Sea in ships specially built by the Wise King to carry the precious heavy cargo. There on the other side, her travel continued through the jeweled city of Aqaba placed on the ancient caravan route. Not knowing it then, she was heading towards her love, the love that became legendary, the love between the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. The legend about the love between Makeda (or Balqis in Arabian) and King Solomon still lives in legends, poems, tales…and in a fragrance. It lives again through Aqaba, a fragrant memento of legendary love…of all loves.\nThe fragrances of Miriam Mirani received many accolades from world\'s renowned magazines such as Essence, German Vogue, Mademoiselle, Italian Elle, etc.\nAqaba Classic is a seductive and exciting fragrance which uses ingredients from the traditional Arabian perfumery. This amazingly lasting fragrance opens with powerful rose blended with spices and precious frankincense and develops into a charming and irresistible sweet trace. The composition is built of Damask rose, frankincense, Egyptian jasmine, Bulgarian rose, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, peach, tea leaves, white cedarwood and, oak moss. The fragrance is captured into an interesting round-shaped bottle the details of which are reminiscent of the ancient love story – the faux ruby represents the ruby inlaid throne of Sheba, while the heavy brass bottle cap features the crowns of ancient royalty. The bottle comes in a red draw-string pouch reminiscent of Arabian jewelry pouches.\nDesigner Aqaba has 13 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1998 and the newest is from 2018. Aqaba fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Thierry Wasser, Jean-Pierre Subrenat, Miriam Mirani and Vito Lenoci.',

As an internationally recognized brand, Blackglama is sought after by sophisticated consumers who recognize the brands stellar 45-year heritage.\n“This is the perfectly natural and logical first step in expanding the brand,” says Joe Morelli, CEO of Blackglama, “because fragrance is such a personal statement, an intimate and beautiful accessory that communicates so much about the person who wears it. And perfume, like fur, is not just a material object; it’s a sensual experience.”\nThe quartet of Blackglama scents evocatively named Mythic, Icon, Epic and Addiction are distinct compositions, each with a different mood, and each in a different fragrance family. Skilled artisans of perfumery designed the scents to capture the exuberance a woman feels when she’s enveloped in a Blackglama fur. Each of these four compositions uses a different balance of energetic top-notes, luscious floral middle-notes and exotic, earthy and provocative base-notes. The result: a line of fragrances any legend would love to wear under her Blackglama fur.\nBlackglama is a new fragrance brand.

His products and business acumen would carry him from the pharmacies of Chicago to his own shop on the city's famed Michigan Avenue, specializing in perfumes. His innovations with perfume packaging helped him secure a patent in 1907 for his method of preserving a flower within a perfume bottle. A leader in his trade and an advocate for the burgeoning fragrance industry in the United States, Blocki's fragrances and cosmetics were top-sellers in the early 20th century. Blocki is remembered today as a pioneer in the history of U.S. fragrances.\nIn the 21st century, Blocki's great-great grandson and his wife began experimenting with essential oils and floral waters, which would eventually lead to the revival of the Blocki brand. In 2015, on the the 150th anniversary of the founding of the original Blocki perfumery, Blocki Perfumes was relaunched with a collection of three fragrances inspired by the writings of John S.

			"Bobbi Brown is an American cosmetic brand, founded by the eponymous professional make-up artist.\nBobbi was fascinated by cosmetics as she, as a young girl, watched her mother put it on. She got her first professional training in make-up in a small cosmetic store in her town. After graduating in theatrical make-up at Boston's Emerson College, Bobbi moved to New York and tried to make it big as a freelancer make-up artist in Manhattan. After a number of gigs at fashion magazines, models and photographers, her big success came first with a seven-page spread of beauty shots with supermodel Tatiana Patitz shot by Wayne Maser and the make-up for a cover of American Vogue. The cover featured Naomi Campbell and was shot by the celebrity photographer Patrick Demarchelier.\nAfter ten years of freelancer business, she decided to create her own, simple and natural-look make up and she consulted a chemist about it: \"I had the idea to create a lipstick that didn't smell, wasn't dry or greasy, and looked like lips, only better—and I told the chemist about it\". In 1991, Bobbi Brown debuted her make up with ten brownish and natural shades of lipstick at the Bergdorf Goodman under the name of Bobbi Brown Essentials and immediately sold a hundred lipsticks within the first day. Her cosmetic range expanded beyond lipstick. For example, her foundations were revolutionary because they were yellow-based, not pink-based as it was usual. The Estée Lauder company bought the brand in 1995, just four years after the company’s founding and kept Bobbi Brown’s creative control of the brand.\nBobbi described what she finds beautiful at her official site: “A strong brow, bedroom eyes, a bump on the nose – these are the features that inspire me. Beauty isn’t about looking perfect. It’s about celebrating your individuality.” She believes that every woman should praise her unique and natural beauty and feels that her make-up products can help them with that. “Makeup is a way for a woman to look and feel like herself, only prettier and more confident”.\nBobbi wrote several books about cosmetics, beuty and lifestyle and is a New York Times bestselling author. Those books are: Bobbi Brown Beauty, Bobbi Brown Teenage Beauty, Bobbi Brown Beauty Evolution, Bobbi Brown Living Beauty and Bobbi Brown Makeup Manual. Since 2001, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics helps “Dress for Success” charity organization to help disadvantaged women get their independence and confidence back.\nDesigner Bobbi Brown has 7 perfumes in our fragrance base.

One of the earliest fragrances developed by Doussan, Kus Kus, was launched in 1843 and is still a best-seller for the house. Doussan took a business partner, J.H. Tindel, a young chemist who had studied perfumery while in Europe, and changed the store's name to Bourbon French Perfume Company.\nThe store continued to prosper over the years and was eventually sold to Marguerite Caro, who had worked in the shop for a number of years and studied perfumery under Tindel's guidance. In 1973, Marguerite's granddaughter, Alessandra Crain, inherited the business. The current owner, Mary Eleftorea Behlar, bought the business from Alessandra in 1991.\nThe house continues to offer some of the original fragrances created by Doussan and Tindel, with successive owners also contributing new fragrances to the collection over the years.

He has since published fifteen books and won more awards and acclaim, including a second James Beard award for Cooking in 2008.\nPeterson's fascination with cuisine eventually led him to the fragrance world, when a mention of ambergris in a 16th-century French culinary text led to experiments with aromatic substances.

			'"Chris Collins is an USA niche fragrance brand launching with three distinct scents for the sophisticated consumer who travels the world and appreciates the finer, more exclusive things and experiences in life. Harlem Nights, Renaissance Man, and Danse Sauvage are the result of Chris’s continued love affair with fragrance, dating back to his teenage years. A meeting and subsequent collaboration with famed French perfumer Kilian Hennessy paved the way for stories of perfume to be created. Chris later on spent months in Grasse, France - the birthplace of fragrance - to learn the process of transforming notes into memorable scent experiences, immersing himself in its artisty. The perfumers in Grasse taught him this: transmuting a common substance, the notes, into something of greater value, the fragrance; a process so magical that it was akin to creating the elixir of life. From his life-changing immersion in Paris and life as a New Yorker in his historic brownstone in Harlem, Chris has brought on these three new fragrances to tell the story of a man, and the love affair between these two locales close to his heart." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Chris Collins has 7 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'Cynthia Ann "Cindy" Crawford was born in 1966 in Illinois, USA. While she was jobbing as a corn harvest helper when she and her looks were discovered by a newspaper photographer who took her picture. When she learned that her picture got positive feedback, she decided to give modelling a try. At the age of 17 she entered a modelling contest hosted by Elite Models Management and finished second straight away. Shortly after the same modelling agency signed her. She finished high school and intended to study chemical engineering after having won an academic scholarship, but with her model career taking off, she decided to concentrate on modelling and left university. After working in Chicago with a renowned photographer she moved to Manhattan, New York in 1986. She signed a contract with Elite New York and within short time the name of Cindy Crawford became a household name.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s her model fame was catapulted to superstardom when Cindy, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Christy Turlington unwittingly became supermodels. For years Cindy\'s photos were gracing countless magazine covers and she was named one of the most beautiful women in the world. Cindy was the face of many marketing campaigns by globally successful enterprises. Among them are Versace, Escada, Revlon, Maybelline, Clariol and Omega. Her looks and her popularity opened many doors for her. In the 1990s Cindy was hired to star in music videos by George Michael and Jon Bon Jovi.\nWhen she had the chance to launch her own fragrance line, Cindy did not hesitate and took up on the offer. Cindy Crawford Feminine is a floral fragrance with prominent notes of water lily, gardenia, sandalwood, apple, amber, bergamot and mahogany. Cindy Crawford Joyful, a fruity-floral fragrance, was developed by perfumers of the well-known house of Givaudan. In 2002 her self-tiled fragrance, a floral composition based on intense gardenia, freesia and mimosa, was successfully launched. 2006 saw the launch of the fruity-floral composition Summer Day. This fragrance was built around strong bamboo, orchid accords and aquatic nuances. Waterfalls, her most recent fragrance launch, dates back to 2005. The composition of waterfalls is floral-aquatic with notes of peony, jasmine, freesia, violet, citruses and lotus.\nDesigner Cindy Crawford has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2002 and the newest is from 2006. Cindy Crawford fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Givaudan and Mark Buxton.',

Instead, it is designing three pieces which, when mixed together, will conceive the masterpiece: The Perfume.\nClaude Marsal combined exquisite, elegant, intricate, and aromatic scents to create an allure that is impossible to resist.\nAll Claude Marsal's perfumes are 24% fragrance oil which means Claude Marsal's fragrance is, in fact, Eau de Parfum, and it will stay on your skin much longer.

Beth envisioned a crisp, clean scent to capture that effervescent moment, but without any formal training in fragrances nobody thought it was possible.\nBeth used her innate aesthetic sense to create Te, the first green tea-based perfume. Te was an instant success when it was introduced in 1995, selling out at Barneys New York, Maxfield and Colette Paris. It is now part of the world’s leading niche fragrance collection, Beth Terry for Creative Universe.

			'"My natural botanical perfume making is facilitated by my study of music, particularly opera. This language also achieves the status of the above quote. Music speaks to our souls, just like Perfume. It pleases me to no end, that I can combine the two, into something more than they would be on their own.\n"I started learning this craft, with a DIY kit. Mixed it up, had fun, and waited the appropriate amount of time. When it was \'done,\' I smelled it, and thought, \'Huh, that turned out pretty good…\' Ordered another. Then I ordered Mandy Aftel’s book, Essence and Alchemy. I was entranced for most of the book, though when I got to the image of individual essences as musical notes, that was the clincher. I majored in Music at Simpson College, specifically studying opera. It seemed the Universe was pulling two loves together. Thinking of making music for the nose tantalized me. Then I started ordering all sorts of fun substances to play with, from reputable businesses.\n"It’s very spiritual for me, working with these plant materials that have been used for thousands of years, and by such people as Cleopatra. It grounds me, and connects me to the Earth. I’m finding people pleasantly surprised at how emotionally involved they feel to a natural perfume!\n"My personal philosophy, is that we should be aware of what we ingest into our bodies, whether we are eating it, or using a substance. The skin is our largest organ, and it’s frightening how many chemicals we dump on it during the course of a day, especially women.\n"Perfume making is similar to making wine, as you must have patience to wait until enough time has passed for the alchemal magic to happen."—Amanda Feeley, founder and perfumer\nDesigner Esscentual Alchemy has 49 perfumes in our fragrance base. Esscentual Alchemy is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2010 and the newest is from 2017. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Amanda Feeley.',

Celebrities and wealthy Californians both shopped and hung out at the trendy location whose entrance was capped by a distinctive yellow and white striped awning.\nThe Giorgio Beverly Hills fragrance was launched in 1981 by Fred Hayman and then-wife Gale Hayman with a fanfare normally reserved for a major perfume house launch, and never before seen for an independent boutique brand.

In 2008, Maus Frères S.A. of Switzerland, had acquired 95.6 % of the Gant Company AB shares.\nThe house was founded by Bernard Gant, an immigrant from Ukraine. He soon became a well-known tailor in Manhattan and later on, his sons, Marty and Elliot, along with a cousin, started a family business in New Haven, CT, and started manufacturing shirts.

The Gant approach was to sell through the most prestigious store in town and sales took off quickly.\nGant became known as a designer label in the US, and the first shops were opened in several department stores across the country. The Gant family sold the business in 1967. Ever since then, the company has changed owners.

			'Hercules Man is an American niche perfumery. "It all began when my parents, a hair stylist and a cosmetologist from Greece, brought their expertise to America in the 1970s. Growing up in the salon business, I learned a lot about the industry and explored my deep curiosity about the products people use every day. Knowing the immense benefits of natural ingredients, I couldn’t ignore the abundance of chemical-laden products on store shelves. This led me to develop hair and skincare products based on the belief that clean ingredients are the cornerstone of a healthy grooming routine.\nNow, I’ve infused this philosophy into Hercules Man. All of my fragrances are made from nature’s rich botanicals, with essences found all over the world. Unique scent profiles that are inspired by Greece add dynamic layers that ebb and flow over time within each full-bodied fragrance. The artistry of crafting a fragrance is one of passion, patience and precision, which is why each batch is hand-blended and tested to ensure it embodies my vision.\nHercules Man fragrances use only natural essential oils, resins, and extracts in organic grain alcohol, purely bestowing the power of botanicals on the distinguished man. Be epic." - a note from the brand.\nHercules Man is a new fragrance brand. Designer Hercules Man has 2 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2018.',

He began his journey with an apprenticeship to a South American shaman, working with exotic Amazonian flowers, learning how the plants spoke through their scent. From this beginning he studied the art of distillation and the extraction of scents from plants and began learning the alchemical origins of perfuming.\nMarcus believes that perfuming is a high art and that like all high arts, each piece is unique and must be interwoven with something greater, beyond the physical. The perfume must be exalted ...\nNamed after Orpheus, the progenitor of the Orphic mysteries a legendary musician, poet, and prophet who wrote hymns to the Greek gods and powers, each completed with the burning of a sacred incense—incense that is the base of many of the perfumes Marcus creates—House of Orpheus hopes that each scent will allow the wearer to be stirred and roused by the symphonies of scent.\nA note about ingredients: House of Orpheus does not work with the usual ingredients within most normal perfumes. Not all of the ingredients in House of Orpheus perfumes are added for their scent. The fragrances may contain Alchemical metallic oils, sourced from a master alchemist. Each metallic oil is alchemically transmuted into a safe-to-use oil and is the exalted essence of the metal, not the metal itself. Learn more about the spiritual and alchemical aspects of each perfume on the official House of Orpheus website.\nDesigner House of Orpheus has 10 perfumes in our fragrance base.

A military daughter and later, a military wife, she spent much of her life traveling around the world while indulging a passion for fragrance creation, which she learned from her Creole French mother.\nWhen the stock market crash of 1929 destroyed the family's investment business, Mrs. Hovey-King opened Hové—a play on her last name—at 529 Royal Street. In 1938, the business moved to 723 Toulouse Street where it remained for the next 44 years. Mrs. Hovey-King lived in the gracious quarters on the second floor until her death in 1961, when the business passed to her daughter, Mrs. Jules A. de Fazende Yokum. She continued to run and expand the business, taking her own daughter, Mrs. Julie van Calsem IV, in 1970, as her partner. By 1982, Hové had outgrown the small space and the business was moved to 824 Royal Street. In 1987, Mr. van Calsem joined the firm and after his wife's death in 1989, he became the first man to carry on the tradition of Hové. Mr. Willem F. van Calsem and his current wife, Barbara Ann Downs, continued running Hové until their retirement in 2003, at which time their niece, Amy van Calsem Wendel, who had been involved with Hové a few years past, was eager to continue the family's perfume tradition along with her husband Bill Wendel.

			"Drawing upon her education in philosophy and aesthetics, Joan Vass set out to work in the art world. Beginning as an assistant curator of drawing and prints at the Museum of Modern Art, she then went on to edit art tomes for Harry N. Abrams and as a contributing columnist for Art in America. It was during this time that Joan developed an interest in hand knits & crochets. She tapped into the skills of local women to produce her first designs. This collection, consisting of hats & mufflers, was bought by arbiter of fashion, Henri Bendel. It quickly sold out, changing Joan’s career from observer of art to creator of art. Incorporated in 1977, her eponymous collection expanded into sweaters for both sexes. Using the same local artisans, the designs were unique, limited and beautifully crafted. Demand for Joan’s quirky unstructured knitwear grew during the 1980’s prompting large scale production at Signal Knitting Mills in South Carolina under the label Joan Vass USA. Encompassing all the components of a complete wardrobe – sweaters, trousers, skirts & dresses, the aesthetic remained the same, with fine fabrics, natural fibers and ageless designs. Joan’s unique approach, that of eliminating the excess, leaving a timeless, seasonless collection garnered her many accolades, including the Extraordinary Women in Fashion award from the Smithsonian Institute, Coty American Fashion Critics award and the Prince Machiavelli Prix de Cachet award.The Joan Vass brand continues today with renewed attitude. Building on the tradition of luxurious knitwear since its inception over thirty years ago, this is a collection of understated elegance. Classic silhouettes have been modernized using fabrics that envelop the body in comfortable luxury. Soft silk cashmere sweaters, multidimensional knit jacquards, jerseys and interlocks are styled in ways that pay tribute to the unique aesthetic that is Joan Vass.\nDesigner Joan Vass has 3 perfumes in our fragrance encyclopedia.

			"Somewhere, in the mountains of Europe, the seeds behind our company name were sown. Here, in this territory, treasured oil is distilled from rose blossoms for use in fragrances and skin products. This oil, known as attar, is commonly believed to be a product only of faraway, exotic lands and, to be sure, some distant areas are sources of this precious commodity. Still, the very finest of these attars is prepared in the valleys of the Balkans, a region of southeastern Europe. Balkan is derived from a Turkish word for continuous wooded mountains and, in fact, up and down these Balkan hills dance the roses, exposed to optimal sun conditions and nested in a layer of thin clay soil, awaiting their blooms’ harvest between May and June, year after year; century after century. In the higher slopes of the mountainsides, the flowers become acclimated to tolerating a higher freezing point and thus flourish longer, providing a stronger scent. Further down, the lower freezing point imparts more subtle, delicate attributes to those particular roses. It is the combination of these differing degrees of bouquet that create, arguably, the most superb oils in the world for cosmetic and beautifying formulations like those we provide through the JOOTS product line.\nEven with these details, the JOOTS name continues to be an enigma until one learns that the creator of JOOTS, a man named George, is a descendent of people who hailed from the Balkans, generations ago. And...in one of the many languages of the Balkans, ‘George’ is translated as ‘d-Juro’ and has a shortened, slang nickname of ‘Joots’ in the United States.\nSo there it is—the keystone of how we got our name. Truly fitting, too, for George, the man who bears the designated namesake of Joots, personally guides the progress of each product and carefully safeguards every aspect of JOOTS, the organization. The etymology of JOOTS has its own distinct bloodline that now reaches out to you from its sunshine beginnings on Balkan hills to refresh, replenish and preserve. The Balkan attars—the very bedrock of beautifying creams, scents and other such potions—illuminate why we so very proudly bear the name, JOOTS.\nDesigner Joots has 2 perfumes in our fragrance base.

I wanted to help others by sharing the tricks I had learned and acknowledge all of the incredible talented makeup artists, photographers and models in the industry. I knew that beauty sometimes felt a bit unattainable and cold and I really wanted to change that. Ultimately, Hudabeauty.com became a place for people to feel beautiful and comfortable, and to share their own inspiration and thoughts around beauty.” - Huda Kattan.\n  Designer Kayali has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'Kelly & Jones is a brand new concept in fine fragrance. Its fragrances enhance the nuances of both wine and perfume for a new experiential approach to appreciating the world of wine.\n"Who is wearing perfume in my tasting room?” the winemaker declared, as I swirled my Chardonnay at a California vineyard. I’d suddenly and accidentally defied the etiquette of wine tasting. Wearing perfume while the nose is in the glass is strictly prohibited by oenophiles -it can interfere with the fragrance of wine. But as perfume wafted from my skin, something curious happened. The fragrance notes were perfectly mingling with the wine, enhancing all of the nuances of the bouquet in the glass. While greatly respecting the winemaker’s art, I wondered how I could break the rules and use perfumes to make the nose better appreciate the notes of wine. I returned to my scent studio with 5 bottles of wine in hand, and sniffed and sipped until I created blends that perfectly captured the notes of each of the varietals. The final eau de parfums are a brand new concept in fragrance – essences that offer a perfect pairing to wine. The result is a truly sensorial and experiential approach to wine and perfume, two of the oldest known pleasures in the world." - a note from the perfumer.\nDesigner Kelly & Jones has 19 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'"Mysteriously enticing and elite fragrances from the Krigler dynasty, a historically iconic perfume house born of founder Albert Krigler’s desire to create unique luxury fragrances handcrafted from the finest ingredients around the world. A Berlin-born chemist, Albert Krigler initially worked for the French company Rallet as an apprentice in its Moscow factory.\nIn 1879, Albert Krigler created his first fragrance as an engagement gift for his French-born fiancée. He called this scent, Pleasure Gardenia 79. When he opened his first perfume store in 1904 in St. Petersburg, Russia, Pleasure Gardenia 79 was the first fragrance he introduced offered for sale. Shortly thereafter, he created Hermitage Heritage 04, a man’s fragrance.\nA few years later, in 1909, Krigler moved to the South of France and spent some time in the Champagne region. Krigler perfumes gained popularity and were sold in Prussia and Eastern Europe as well as on the French Riviera. By the year 1914, the war was making changes for everyone, and Krigler became a French-based house.\nKrigler Perfumes rose to its initial fame in the early 1920s as a favorite among celebrities and royals of the era. Tastemakers and trendsetters flocked to Mr. Krigler’s scents, each of which was inspired by high-profile locales such as Monte Carlo, the Italian Riviera, and the Mediterranean.\nIn 1931, Krigler began to sell its fragrances in New York City at the Plaza Hotel. This is the year that America One 31 was created. During the 1940s and World War II, Krigler became a French-American company due to the loss of many European clientele. In the 1950s, business picked up briefly in Europe. Sadly, Albert Krigler passed away in 1954.\nThe fourth generation of Krigler perfumers began to focus on the company’s custom-made services, including fragrances and scented candles. Krigler fragrances are expertly blended to complement, not overpower the wearer. Each lavish scent is lovingly handmade with the most exquisite natural ingredients. Albert Krigler used to make the comment, “If we say to a person, ‘What a nice perfume,’ that means that the perfume is wrong, but if we say ‘You smell good,’ that means that the perfume is perfect for that person.”\nDrawing upon five generations of luxury fragrances, Krigler reopened its doors in 2007 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, the epicenter of elegance since its inaugural debut in 1931. Offering classic fragrances along with updated versions delivering exciting twists to popular favorites, Krigler continues its time-honored tradition of bringing the world of fragrance exceptional craftsmanship. Ben Krigler, the fifth-generation owner who is the driving force behind the business today." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Krigler has 37 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			'After 50 years of work of the fashion house of Lilly Pulitzer via Palm Beach, its owner, Lillian McKim Pulitzer Rousseau (Lilly Pulitzer), decided to take not one fragrant step, but three steps in November 2008. New perfumes in three colours, with beach associations, sunny citruses and gentle flowers will fit in perfectly in creations and years long tradition of this house. The perfumes do not follow trends of a season, but are connected with motifs, creations and history of the brand.\nThe perfumes were named Wink, Squeeze and Beachy. Wink has the motto "wear pink and make the boys wink", Beachy – evokes associations of Palm Beach, and Squeeze – as a reference of a stall with freshly squeezed juice, from which they sent their first deliveries to friends, such as Jackie Kennedy. Colours of creations by this house are lively, cheerful, pastel and optimistic.\nWink opens with aromas of pear nectar, pink freesia and aromas of lush garden, with heart blossoming with a bouquet of roses, white lily and violet, adding crystal amber and white musk in the base. The perfumer of this edition in a pink bottle is Cecile Krakower.\nSqueeze is an exotic fragrance which opens with aromas of litchi, pink grapefruit and red currant. The heart includes lotus and wild rose petals, while the base notes introduce sunny accords of wood and musk. The perfumer of this edition in a yellow bottle is Mathilde Bijaoul.\nBeachy is a fresh, joyful and intoxicating perfume, which offers water melon, sunny citruses and sea breeze aromas in the very opening, while the heart is enriched with jasmine flowers, tiare and frangipani. The base includes salt crystals, golden amber and sweet vanilla. This perfume in a blue bottle was created by Karine Dubreuil.\nDesign director and motifs creator by the house of Lilly Pulitzer, Janie Schoenborn, created combinations of colours and motifs which will be visible on stripes on colour pencil boxes, as well as on perfume package. Wink got primary motifs in pink and green nuances, Squeeze is decorated with yellow and orange, while Beachy is coloured in blues and greens. Secondary motifs are found on outside packages, as well as on body lotions. Design of the bottles was inspired by architecture Via Mizner in Palm Beach.\nLilly Pulitzer is a new fragrance brand. Designer Lilly Pulitzer has 3 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2008. Lilly Pulitzer fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Karine Dubreuil, Mathilde Bijaoui and Cecile Krakower.',

While walking the streets of New York, as well as in her beauty salon, women would stop her and inquire about her great “look” and where they might obtain such a fabulous make-up to rim their own eyes.\nMadeleine Mono saw her golden opportunity and formulated a black carbon base mixed with special oils and named it Indian Eyes. She introduced Indian Eyes make-up first at Henri Bendel’s on 57th Street in Manhattan. Women loved it, and new Madeleine Mono cosmetic counters soon followed at Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s and Lord & Taylor. She was on her way.\nMadeleine Mono introduced her signature fragrance, Madeleine de Madeleine in 1978 to great acclaim. “Sure, the world has many fragrances”, she exclaimed at the time, “but it doesn’t have mine." To this day her Madeleine de Madeleine has a devoted clientele who wear no other eau de parfum.\nMadeleine traveled often for personal appearances, beauty breakfasts, television, radio and press interviews and loved meeting her customers one-on-one to share beauty secrets.\nMake Eyes With Madeleine Mono, her beauty book, was published in 1981. Its contents taught women how easy it is to be beautiful. A New York Times article stated that Madeleine Mono had joined the “cosmetic legends.”\nMadeleine Mono started with little except entrepreneurial spirit and the thrill of a challenge. She did everything herself—designs, product development, packaging, sales and delivery.\nDesigner Madeleine Mono has 2 perfumes in our fragrance base.

He was a pioneer in motion picture make-up and wig-making and won a special Academy Award for his work in 1928. His clientele included some of the old Hollywood’s most famous stars such as Bette Davis, Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford, Pola Negri, Ben Turpin, Jean Harlow, Claudette Colbert, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Judy Garland. That earned him a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nHe developed a few of his own original make-up techniques, such as flexible greasepaint, false eyelashes, the eyebrow pencil, lip gloss, pancake makeup, color harmony range of face powder and Clara Bow’s heart-shaped lips among others, and was the first one who started to refer to his products as “make-up” instead of “cosmetics.” His sons Davis and Frank were involved in the business and they worked on expanding the company outside the movie industry. In 1927 Max Factor introduced his first cosmetics sold to the broad market advertised with a slogan suggesting every girl could look like a movie star by using Max Factor makeup.\nMax Factor remained a family business until it was sold to Norton Simon in 1973. During that period, among other products, they launched Halston fragrance, which became the second best-selling designer fragrance in the world. In 1983 Norton Simon was bought by Esmark that merged with Beatrice Foods a year later, which placed Max Factor into their Playtex beauty division. Playtex beauty division was bought by Revlon in 1986. Revlon sold Max Factor to Procter & Gamble in 1991.\nDesigner Max Factor has 11 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			"Nanette Lepore is a well-respected and talented fashion designer who is based in New York. She was born in Ohio where she grew up with her family. She did part of her studies in her home town of Youngstown, Ohio, before she moved to New York to study design and to start her career as a fashion designer. She longed to have her own label and convinced her dad to give her a loan so that she could set up shop in New York. It was 1992 when she opened a small boutique in the garment district in New York. This boutique attracted local artists and poets and encouraged Nanette to open another boutique in Los Angeles and to sell her collections to clients on other continents, mainly Europe and Asia.\nThe brand of Nanette Lepore developed into a sought-after and respected brand quickly. But it was not until her garments were sold in Neiman Marcus stores that Natette Lepore became a household name and started to attract the attention of celebrities. Among her famous followers are Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington, Jennifer Garner, America Ferrera, Aida Turturro, Illeana Douglas and Lorraine Bracco. In 2007 she launched her first shoe collection in collaboration with Keds. Mischa Barton was chosen to be the face of the marketing campaign. Today the brand's clothing lines are sold in several department stores in the USA. Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's and Neiman Marcus are only a few of them. In addition to department store concessions Nanette Lepore has opened stand-alone stores in Chicago, Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Washington DC and her first European boutique in West London.\nNanette, who was name-checked in one of the Pussycat Dolls' songs, has made a name for herself in the world of fragrances, too. Her first self-titled fragrance from 2004 is a floral-fruity composition with dominant notes of rose, cranberry and violet. 2005 saw the presentation of her second fragrance. Shanghai Butterfly is a women's fragrance built around fresh and luminous notes of citruses and green apples and soft floral accords. Love Bird, the third perfume of the American fashion designer, was released in 2007. This composition is dominated by a floral heart. The fourth fragrance of the house of Nanette Lepore hit the shelves in 2009. This perfume is bursting with oriental and floral notes like incense, red pepper and violet.\nDesigner Nanette Lepore has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 2004 and the newest is from 2017. Nanette Lepore fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Anne Flipo and Gianni Mastrocola.",

		title: "OSM",
		description:
			"OSM, Olfactory Sense Memory, was born out of the idea to artistically share our memories through scent with the rest of the world. It is well known that our brains have a deep connection to scent and memory. The brain stores a memory through a network of neurons that associate with one another. The more connections those neurons build to one another, the stronger the memory is. It’s this lattice work that is what we now know to be a memory. Similarly, in the perfume itself links are made between molecules which when combined together make up something that is greater than its individual parts. To this end, one could say that the perfume is already a memory in itself, just waiting for the wearer to let it compose a memory in their brain. \nAt OSM, we want this association to memory to be even greater and more global, so we plan to take these composition of memories one step further. We plan to engage the consumer in the process of creating fragrances from their memories in addition to developing more of ours. \nOur labels are collages of memories that represent the composition of scent that are in the bottles. Much like an impressionist painting, from afar you get one view and getting closer you can see all the strokes and pieces that make it up. The numbers of the scents are the year or age of the scent memory within the bottle. Our bottles are grey to represent the grey matter (or brain) where memories are formed and stored. \nWe are conscious of our carbon footprint and effects on the planet, so we want our fragrances to be sustainable and our packaging to be as minimal as possible. We also want to give back to the earth. Therefore, we have partnered with 1% For the Planet, an organization whose mission is to “build, support and activate an alliance of businesses financially committed to creating a healthy planet.” 1% of all OSM’s sales go back to the organization.\nOSM is a new fragrance brand. Designer OSM has 4 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2018. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Kyle Mott-Kannenberg.",

Wiedhopf, a visionary whose passion truly belonged to the world of fragrance. He brought Caron to America, was co-founder and first president of the Fragrance Foundation, and gave the world Parfums CIRO. A perfume collection made in France, which from the outset shone with audacity and uncompromising quality and is therefore considered one of the first niche fragrance brands of the olfactory avant- garde. Parfums CIRO captivated fragrance lovers throughout the world. In the nineteen sixties the brands last fragrance appears, which until the nineteen sixties the brand had launched over two dozen creations. \nHalf a century later, Parfums CIRO returns: charismatic fragrance compositions, created by master craftsmen, uniting tradition and modernity yet preserving its historical heritage. Created to capture the hearts of perfumistas and perfume lovers and to continue the success story of the brand. A myth that shines in new splendor - the rebirth of a legend. As an homage to the CIRO brand and its legacy, these classic compositions served as inspiration for today\'s perfumers who have not only reinterpreted each fragrance but have also retained the names of the almost 100-year-old perfume creations. \nPerfumes CIRO has always excelled with their impressive flacon designs. The new flacon pays tribute to these historical masterpieces: an elegant, slim silhouette made of solid glass forms the exquisite vessel for the perfume creations, effectively contrasted and framed by opaque black sides. Harmoniously rounded shoulders carry a weighty metal lid finished with real gold plating. A play of contrasts: black and white, opaque and transparent - the striking design elements, combined with the distinctive typography, create a symbiosis of the Art Deco style and the reduced-elegant form language of modern design.\nThe new fragrance creations continue to tell the story of the brand – far from the mainstream. Exquisite ingredients, transformed by famous perfumers into fascinating fragrance compositions. Glamorous and characteristic, with a brilliant radiance thanks to high perfume oil concentrations. Extraordinary fragrant moments that create a sensual pleasure – for fragrance aficionados, parfumistas and olfactory nonconformists." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Parfums Ciro has 9 perfumes in our fragrance base.

The one of a kind scents, inspired by the owner’s upbringing and time spent in her youth at hippy communes and theosophical camps throughout the Pacific North West , and California (tending medicinal herb gardens with respected herbologists) are earthy yet whimsical, drawing on the therapeutic properties and psychoactive effects of herbs and plants used for medicinal purposes…some even dating back to ancient times, used by shamans and tribes seeking spiritual awakening, altered states of consciousness and euphoria. \nWith premier fashion houses expanding into the realm of home décor, design, art, and architecture (i.e. Furniture’s by Rick Owens, the Prada Foundation in Milan), the Photogenics + Co creative team aims to utilize its own background in fashion to create visually impactful, sculptural, and architecturally-inspired pieces…to contribute to modern culture in a way that has not yet been seen. Their freshman collection of vessels are made from raw concrete textures and metals to draw on the modern “Brutalist Architecture” movement which flourished from the 1950’s to the mid 1970’s…an aesthetic which continues to give Photogenics + Co its strong, modern, minimalist edge." - a note from the brand.\nDesigner Photogenics + Co has 6 perfumes in our fragrance base.

Paul does this with full confidence of issuing great products of extraordinary quality. He is a leader in the new “Real Perfumery” movement, which consists of perfumers who believe that Real Perfumery uses the best ingredients available to them, to make the best possible fragrances, and composes to Standards of Excellence, instead of standards of weakness. Paul (at least hopes to know) knows what is important to consumers and fragrance fanatics, to have eco and body conscious beautiful fragrances that last well, and are importantly different and beautiful, but are certainly not bland. Paul’s fragrances are a fantastic blend of the world’s best naturals and aromatics creating stunning and new creations. PK Perfumes employs and enjoys the best of all materials available. Natural essential oils, Absolutes, resins, and resinoids all figure prominently in all formulations, and range from between 20-50% of the fragrance. Natural elements bring a full and beautiful rounding grace to the longevity and strength offered by other materials. This is what he calls, “Real Perfumery”, which is the classic style of the great perfumers of the early 20th century. With the inclusion of so many naturals in the mix, the fragrances hearken back to the early years of Guerlain and Ernest Beaux. The vast majority of mass market fragrances have little to zero naturals included in their formulations, because naturals are more expensive to include. And most all natural fragrances seem to last for but a few hours and then they are gone.

The company offered a service called "color-printing" that helped customers find the color family and foundation cosmetic color that best complimented their skin tone.\nPrescriptives entered the fragrance world in 1987 with its first perfume, Calyx, signed by Sophia Grojsman. The cheerful fruity floral blend was a forerunner of the fruity-floral fragrance trend that took hold in the late 20th century, and remains a best-selling fragrance with women of all ages. Prescriptives offered a special limited edition called Calyx Sheer Exhilaration in 2009. A few other fragrances were introduced in the line as well, but none has matched the enduring popularity of Calyx.\nEstee Lauder Companies shocked the cosmetics world in 2009 when it announced the closure of the Prescriptives line, after 30 years. Long-time customers lamented the loss of their favorite products and colors.

			"Priscilla Presley, the ex-wife of Elvis Presley and mother of Lisa-Marie Presley was born Priscilla Ann Wagner in 1945. She spent some of her late childhood in Germany where she, at the age of 14, met Elvis Presley. She married the singer in 1967 and gave birth to her daughter in 1968. The marriage to Elvis Presley did not last and Priscilla eventually decided to go her own way, make her own decisions and to open a shop with her stylist and friend Olivia Bis. Priscilla then wanted to work as a model and actress, dreams that she could not fulfill while having been married to Elvis Presley.\nIn 1983 she was cast for a role in the TV series The Fall Guy and for the movie Love Is Forever. It was also in 1983 that she took on the role of Jenna Wade in the popular TV show Dallas. She has been part of the plot on and off from 1983 to 1985. Priscilla Presley shot to worldwide fame when she played the role of Jane Spencer, Leslie Nielsen's love interest, in the comedy movie The Naked Gun. She appeared as the female lead actress in two more successful sequels of the Naked Gun alongside Leslie Nielsen.\nIn Aaron Spelling's cult TV show Melrose Place Presley's part was that of playing Nurse Benson in a few episodes in 1996. In the 1998 TV movie Breakfast with Einstein, she played the role of Keelin. In the following year she made two appearances on the comedy show Spin City. The last movie she appeared in was Hayley Wagner, Star from 2000.\nIn 1988, the same year that she starred in the first of the three The Naked Gun movies, Priscilla Presley ventured into the world of perfumes. The first fragrance for women that was launched under the brand name of Priscilla Presley was Moments. Moments was built around intense notes of aldehydes, amber, patchouli, orris root and oakmoss. The fragrance and matching body products sold well and convinced her and Procter & Gamble to further break into the beauty sector. Experiences, the second fragrance, was aimed at real women with real life experiences. The scent featured dominant notes of aldehydes and rose.\nIn 1995 Indian Summer was introduced to the market. It was probably the most loved of all scents of the Priscilla Presley brand. The floral-green composition with intense notes of tea, rose, lotus, violet, cedar and citruses attracted a large fan base. Roses And More, the 4th fragrance of Priscilla Presley, hit the shelves in 1998. It was an instant hit with the customers and is still considered as one of the loveliest rose soliflores of all time. Her last collection of fragrances, all of them limited editions of the Indian Summer line, was launched in 2000. Indian Summer Red, Indian Summer Blue and Indian Summer Green were Indian Summer spin-offs that were aimed at different characters. This collection sold out quickly.\nPriscilla Presley is an avid supporter of the Dreams Foundation, a charity that helps terminally ill people make the most of their dreams.\nDesigner Priscilla Presley has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			"Régime des Fleurs is a brand whose core message communicates the profundity found in flowers. As Siddhārtha Gautama wordlessly proclaimed in his most famous sermon, a single flower - like a messenger from another realm - contains a depth of beauty that has the power to elevate consciousness... and thereby heal.\nRégime des Fleurs was founded in Los Angeles in 2013 by Alia Raza and Ezra Woods. Longtime friends and collaborators, Raza and Woods first bonded over a mutual love of flowers and an intense interest in perfume, eventually leading them to experiment with combining exquisite natural flower extractions for their personal use. This exploration created a space for conversations wherein Raza and Woods discovered shared mutual references and obsessions: a nostalgia for the fresh and bold aesthetic of the early 1990s, a connection to the opulence of the Ancien Régime as epitomized by the Château de Versailles, a fascination with the allegorical insights found in Classical mythology. Out of this creative exchange, Régime des Fleurs took form. In February 2014, Régime des Fleurs launched with a collection of six perfumes in three tiers: the Lyrics, the Ballads, and the Epic.\nDesigner Regime des Fleurs has 26 perfumes in our fragrance base. Regime des Fleurs is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2014 and the newest is from 2019. Regime des Fleurs fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Alia Raza, Ezra Woods, Jerome Epinette, Mark Sage, Pierre Negrin and Mathieu Nardin.",

Her fragrances are worn and loved by celebrities, stylists and media personalities- seen on the shelves of world class retailers such as Barney's New York, Anthropologie, Fred Segal and Nordstrom. You can find SHP featured in Cosmopolitan, Elle and InStyle Magazine making fans out of shoppers with the most discerning of taste.  The heart and soul of SHP has always been customization- distilling the essence of who you are and what you love into a bottle. \nFinding the perfect fragrance for you can bring you into the moment and remind you of who you are and what you love,” says Sarah Horowitz-Thran, founder of Sarah Horowitz Parfums, a Westlake Village, CA-based fragrance house credited with the creation of Sarah’s own lines, SHP Evolution, the Perfect Perfumes, What Comes From Within and the Perfumers Palette and as well as a number of blockbuster private label and custom fragrances that have attracted a cult following among fashion industry insiders and celebrities across the US. \nSarah began designing custom fragrances in the late 1980’s as a freshman at Emerson College. A theater major, she stumbled upon part-time work at an off-beat, apothecary- style perfumery called Essence on Boston’s famed Newbury Street, which specialized in creating custom fragrances for its clientele. Fueled by an intuitive knack for perfumery and the conviction that fragrance was a vehicle for self-expression, Sarah would work one-on- one with clients for hours at a time to design their perfect customized scent. She called this process The Fragrance Journey, which would become the heart and soul of her business - now commanding upwards of $1000 for a custom perfume. After nearly four years apprenticing at Essence, Sarah, with help from her family, purchased the store where she continued to fine-tune her craft and build a reputation as an accomplished and imaginative nose. In 1994, she sold her stake, packed up her perfume oils and moved to Los Angeles where she founded Creative Scentualization, which later gave birth to Sarah Horowitz Parfums.\nSarah spent the next several years toting her fragrance organ (a collection of more than 100 fragrance oils housed in a wooden case) around the beaches of Malibu and Los Angeles conducting Fragrance Journeys and designing custom fragrances for clients. Soon, she was attracting a slow-but-steady underground following of discerning women with varied professional backgrounds. Sarah’s intuitive, non-formulaic approach to fragrance development makes her sought after both by individuals as well as niche and emerging brands which tap Sarah Horowitz Parfums to create both statement-making perfumes and home fragrances that are truly one-of-a-kind.\nDesigner Sarah Horowitz Parfums has 51 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1997 and the newest is from 2019. Sarah Horowitz Parfums fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Marlene Stang and Sarah Horowitz.",

			"\"I was raised in Bellwood, Pennsylvania. A small rural town located in Central Pennsylvania. I grew up surrounded by the beauty and mystery of the Appalachian Mountains. The mountains presented beauty and magic in its ever changing foliage and wildlife with every season, as well as the mystery of the unexplored regions that left a small boy with many imagined stories of adventure.\nMy passion for scents and perfumes began around the age of 11. My grandmother always wore Chanel N°5. I became inquisitive of the scent and would nag her with questions about the scent, the designer, and how it became to be. My grandmother would regale stories of Coco Chanel. She explained how Coco was uneducated, untrained, and raised in an orphanage and yet she created an empire of fashion and perfume. The more I learned about Coco Chanel, the more I became intrigued and admired her. I was also influenced by her timeless fashion designs and jewelry.\nChanel N°5, to me, represented a love story between King Jasmine and Queen Rose—they meet center stage where they dance, they flirt, and entice each other. It is an abstract and elusive scent that brings you back with the hope of solving the mystery. Chanel once stated 'Perfume is the unseen, unforgettable, ultimate accessory of fashion...that heralds your arrival and prolongs your departure.' I wanted to be included in that world of creating lasting and lingering memories. Chanel N°5 had set the standard by which everything else is measured.\nMy grandmother purchased my first scent for me, Chanel Antaeus. The scent was named after a Greek God whose strength was connected to Earth. He was defeated by Heracles when he discovered Antaeus weakness of keeping him separated from Earth by lifting him off the ground. The scent embodied who Antaeus was—lean and powerful.\nI studied fashion at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. My studies included a course on perfume making. Upon graduating from the Art Institute I went on to study at Point Park University School of Business Accounting & Computer Sciences. I was attracted to Point Park University because it houses one of the most prestigious conservatory school in the United States. The dance program founder and Professor Emeritus is none other than Nickolas Petrov, the internationally acclaimed dancer, choreographer and artistic director.\nMy scent creations are heavily influenced by my love of latte and the movie Suspiria. The Suspiria trilogy was the influence for Immortal Meadow, Black Magic, and Wish Upon a Star. They share thematic similarities in the grass and berry notes. Espresso Royale was obviously influenced for my love of latte with the sweet addition of hazelnut and/or caramel.\nAmerican Perfumery\nTo be a part of the world of indie scents to me is the opportunity to share memories and experiences. A writer can create a story with a pen, an artist can create a vision with paints and canvass, and a musician can express with instruments. I choose the world of scent to create a bond with others through the world of memories, dreams, and aspirations through smell. The sense of smell is closely linked with memory, probably more so than any of our other senses. A particular scent can recall a long-forgotten event or experience, often spontaneously. Smell is also very emotive. A scent can inspire various emotions from attraction to aspirations. The slightest scent can create a conversation with others, and a bond in sharing memories. It is an honor to be a part of that.\nFavorite Perfume Artist\nMy favorite Indie Perfume Artist is Nikolay Eremin of St. Petersburg, Russia. I am a huge fan of his scents, creativity, and his unique artistic view. He is a mentor as well as a friend. He provides me with encouragement with a dose of reality, and inspiration to always strive to do better and to be a better version of who I am.\"\n—Robert Elder, founder and perfumer of Sebastiane\nDesigner Sebastiane has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			"Each year, the Six Scents Fragrance initiative brings the experience of creativity with a conscience to the world through a collection of six individual scents. Created by a distinct group of designers and perfumers, these limited edition fragrances are designed to represent a global range of contemporary views on creativity and culture. The designers’ concepts and the perfumers’ knowledge of fine fragrance are combined to explore new perfume compositions.\nIn 2008 an interesting collection of perfumes named Six Scents was launched as a product of fertile cooperation of the houses of Symrise, Metaproject and Seven New York. It gathered perfumers and artists with an aim to present a fragrant scale, contemporary view of creativity, culture, awareness and collecting.\nThe collection encompasses six fragrances, each created by one of the following artists: Alexandre Herchovitch, Bernhard Willhelm, Cosmic Wonder, Gareth Pugh, Jeremy Scott and Preen. They presented themselves with their work by shaping this collection and dedicating it to \"Designers Against Aids - DAA\". The aim of this collection is to collect money for charities.\nSix Scents collection includes the perfumes:\n1. Alexandre Herchcovitch: Urban Tropicalia\n2. Bernhard Willhelm: Wicken 3000\n3. Cosmic Wonder: Spirit of Wood\n4. Gareth Pugh: Diagonal\n5. Jeremy Scott: Illicit Sex\n6. Preen: Teen Spirit\nIn 2009 Six Scents: Series Two was introduced and it included fragrances by: Phillip Lim, Henry Holland, Damir Doma, Henrik Vibskov, Richard Nicoll, and Toga. Individually numbered with custom packaging, each fragrance will be offered in a limited quantity of 2,000 bottles. A percentage of the net proceeds will go toward Pro-Natura in support of their environmental sustainability programs.\nSix Scents: Series Two explores the relationship between artist and nature through a collection of six fragrances, stories, films, art pieces, and photographic contributions.\nEach designer was invited to imagine a place, action, and person that would be the basis of their fragrance; from each response, a story evolved. The perfumers, directors, photographers, artists, designers and writers that have collaborated on Six Scents: Series Two were asked to interpret these stories as they understood them. This collection reflects themes of beauty and nature through various ingredients.\nIn 2010 the latest series from Six Scents perfume, Six Scents Series Three was launched. It brings together prominent perfumers and designers again, in order to provide an olfactory interpretation revolving around the main theme, which is 'childhood memories'. The rising design stars: Alexis Mabille, Mary Katrantzou, Junn.J, Rad Hourani, N. Hoolywood, and Ohne Titel, are paired with perfumers from Givaudan house. The collection consists of six fragrances, associated with the name of one of the artists.\nSix Scents Series Three includes the following fragrances:\n1. Alex Mabille Beau Bow\n2.

			"In Brazil, we believe you’re as beautiful as you feel. We think beauty isn’t a universal standard, but an attitude – a confidence that comes when you feel good in your skin. It’s about playing up your best assets and celebrating what’s unique and joyful. And what feels good. Our brand of beauty is more of a head-to-toe sensuality, a universal body language that says so much and comes through in a warm smile, a saunter, a samba. It’s smooth, glowy, dewy skin that’s irresistible to touch – and flaunt. And gorgeous to look at. It’s an addictively delicious fragrance that invites you to breathe deep and inspires you to feel deeply. With passion and playfulness.\nBrazilian Beautiful is fun, spontaneous, full of life – and always contagious. Inspired by Brazilian Beauty Secrets, our products just have a way of bringing people together, inviting touch, sharing, and inspiring feel-good feelings. And we love your body with all our Sol. Que gostoso. (from the brand's website)\nDesigner Sol de Janeiro has 4 perfumes in our fragrance base. Sol de Janeiro is a new fragrance brand.

Intrigued by the rich history of the bay rum industry and other experimenters before him, Webb mixed this versatile essential oil with exotic Caribbean spices to create a distinctly masculine scent. He went on to package these bottles by hand using local palm fronds, and from there, St Johns Bay Rum™ was created, bringing the allure of the islands to the U.S. Recognized worldwide, these “Fishnet Weave®” bottles have since become iconic, embodying the essence and guiding principles of the St Johns Bay Rum™ brand: Authentic, Distinctive, Timeless, Traditional.

			'Samuel Timothy "Tim" McGraw is an American country singer and actor, married to singer Faith Hill. From his debut in the early \'90s, he had a lot of success and became the most popular male singer in country music. He published several multi-platinum albums with his characteristic sound - commercial country, updated honky tonk, country-rock and contemporary ballads.\nThe singer was born and raised in Louisiana. After studying sports medicine he decided to dedicate to music and went to perform and sing in Nashville clubs for a couple of years. His first album was published in 1993.\nMcGraw\'s breakthrough hit from was Not a Moment Too Soon, known as "Indian Outlaw", in 1994. It reached the country Top Ten and even crossed over to the pop Top 20. This album was selling over five million copies and topping both the country and pop album charts; it was also the best-selling country album of the year.\nIn 1996, McGraw supported the album with an extensive tour, accompanied by opening act Faith Hill. After the tour was over, McGraw and Hill married, in a union of country star power followed by the media. McGraw\'s next album, 1997\'s Everywhere, featured a McGraw-Hill duet called "It\'s Your Love,". The second duet by the couple was"Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me," released in 1998.\nWith the multi-platinum success of Everywhere, McGraw was poised to take over Brooks\' throne as the king of contemporary country. In 1999 he launched triple-platinum A Place in the Sun, hit number one country and pop. 2000 brought McGraw\'s first Grammy, for Best Country Vocal Collaboration - duet from Hill\'s Breathe album, "Let\'s Make Love."\nA great hit was his 2001 album Set This Circus Down, giving him four more number ones on charts! The Tim McGraw album was released in late 2002, and it also featured a faithful cover of Elton John\'s "Tiny Dancer." McGraw kept the formula the same on 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, utilizing his road band, as well as co-mixing/producing the record himself. Let It Go followed in 2007, with Southern Voice arriving in 2009. McGraw had a major role in the film Country Strong which was released in 2011. The singer’s latest album is Emotional Traffic, which was finally issued in January of 2012.\nThe singer has also launched two perfumes for men – McGraw and Southern Blend.

Base notes finish with amber, patchouli, sandalwood and tonka, decorated with intoxicating aromas of whiskey.\nCoty Beauty and Tim McGraw presented another fragrance in 2009, named Southern Blend. Tim McGraw\'s wish was not to name this fragrance in French style (just like his first edition, Tim McGraw), but to make it an approachable, everyday fragrance, strong and charming. Southern Blend incorporates essences of man from the South, who is masculine, charismatic, strong, but also sexy and tough in the same time. This composition includes grapefruit, star annis, bergamot, lavender, violet leaf, whiskey, vetiver, amber and tobacco.

			"Tova Borgnine, a Norwegian-American businesswoman and the 5th wife of actor Ernest Borgnine launched her beauty brand after successfully testing a cream on the famous character face of her husband. She obtained the formula from a Mexican family, placed marketing campaigns in tabloids and soon word was out that her face cream, dubbed face lift in a jar, was highly effective fighting wrinkles.\nOriginally Tova intended to sell her beauty products via prestigious department stores. But as she never managed to sign a deal with any of the major department store chains, she started printing catalogs over which she sold her merchandise. Her beauty and spa products and her fragrances are now almost exclusively sold via QVC, a home shopping TV channel, and via QVC's web site. Only a small percentage of the company's sales is made from catalog orders. Her success enabled her to open the Tova Wellness Institute in Beverly Hills, California, USA. Tova's success is partly based on her charming and winning personality, her determination to produce and sell premium skin care and her elegant appearance.\nBy 2000 she has managed to sell more than 4 million bottles of perfume via courageous direct marketing on QVC without ever spraying a single drop of fragrance onto any customer's skin. Her first fragrance, Tova for women, was launched in 1982. The composition is an intense and strong one and reflects Tova's determination. The main notes of Tova for women are bergamot, lavender, jasmine, sandalwood and musk. Tova Signature, a floral-woody-musky fragrance for women with dominant notes of bergamot, aldehydes, lavender, jasmine, musk and sandalwood, was presented in 1983. 1992 was the launch of Body Mind & Spirit, a fresh, relaxing and soft floral fragrance for women based on osmanthus, apricot, white roses, jasmine, heliotrope, lily of the valley, sandalwood, amber and musk.\nTova Nights, a well-blended floral perfume, was presented in 1997. The composition centers around carefully selected notes of peony, spices, lily, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, violet, lilac and rose. 2002 was the year that Nirvana, an oriental and spicy composition inspired by the Indian and Chinese cuisines, was launched. The fragrance features notes of bergamot, pineapple, ylang-ylang, nutmeg, white pepper, freesia, jasmine, rose, violet, green tea, patchouli, rosewood, sandalwood and ebony. More fragrances have been presented since.\nDesigner Tova Beverly Hills has 14 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1982 and the newest is from 2009.

Stern named her perfume business after two of her beloved cats, whose images are immortalized in her elaborate, fanciful packaging. Her cats can often be found lounging in the Perfumer’s Garden above San Francisco Bay, enveloped in the fragrance of the flowers that often end up in Stern’s perfumes.\nFor Stern, the Purrfumery represents a coming together of years of study and a wide range of passions: her love of flowers, of animals, of Victoriana, of making unique gifts, of using the finest materials the world has to offer, and of always making time to rejuvenate and smell the roses. In business since 2006, she creates wondrous perfumes, colognes, body oils, bath salts and body frostings using natural floral, wood, seed, spice and citrus essences. Her business is certified by “Leaping Bunny,” a coalition of eight animal protection groups, who ensure that none of her ingredients or her supplier’s ingredients are tested on animals. Stern collects many ingredients for her perfumes from her own Perfumer’s Garden, and even uses beeswax from her own bees. She blends each of her beautiful scents with organic grape alcohol and jojoba bases, and refuses to use synthetics or harsh chemicals such as phthalates. Her perfumes are 100 percent cruelty-free and do not contain even a trace of animal musk or animal fixatives.\nDesigner Velvet & Sweet Pea’s Purrfumery has 19 perfumes in our fragrance base.

After about a year of toying with the business plan, and trying to find some great formulas to purchase, our inspiration waned and the project was shelved.\nLater, in October of 1999, inspiration struck again, along with a renewed determination. With my knowledge of chemistry, I knew I could formulate some excellent fragrances. Wow, was I wrong. Apparently, I knew just enough to create some very fine insect repellents! Well, maybe they weren't that bad; however, from those months of experimentation, I learned that the science of aromatic formulation is far more exacting than I had imagined. I needed education; it made all the difference! The more I learned, the better my formulations became.\nBy 2005, I had settled on a great theme for my new fragrances. Being an avid sailor, and having visited some really fascinating ports-of-call, I was profoundly influenced by their beauty, pace of life, and, of course, the wonderful scents of indigenous flowers and spices, all of which factored heavily into the creation of each fragrance.\nI was now confident that my fragrances were exceptional.

As it was her children that gave her the will and the energy to realize this dream it seemed evident that the name of the line should be dedicated to them. For Les Soeurs de Noe, Nadia has remained true to her fundamental values: authenticity, respect, candor and generosity.\nLes Soeurs de Noe represents the indefectible bond between the Orient and the West, a link between these cultures, so rich in their diversity and their histories. And the line also harbors a deep respect for the fundamental ingredients and the people responsible for their production.\nThe magic and the emotions that emanate from Les Soeurs de Noe empathize the superb skills of the various actors in the creation of these perfumes.\nLes Soeurs de Noe has established a partnership with Robertet, a family owned business which guarantees remarkable transparency and traceability of its supplies of fundamental ingredients and offers particular support to the people who cultivate them.\nEach of Les Soeurs de Noe perfumes is committed to the unconditional attention to the people involved and the respect for the environment.\nThe noble ingredients, assembled by the two master perfumers of New York, Jerome Epinette and Pierre Wulff, prove that creativity and respect for the planet are connected.\nEach perfumed story spectacularly renders the mystery of an instant, an olfactive translation of a precise emotion, which becomes unique upon contact with the skin of the wearer." - a note from the brand.\nLes Soeurs de Noe is a new fragrance brand. Designer Les Soeurs de Noe has 5 perfumes in our fragrance base all launched in 2019. Les Soeurs de Noe fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Jerome Epinette and Pierre Wulff.',

			"Royall Fragrances are inspired by semi – tropical paradise of the island archipelago of Bermuda, also known as the “jewel in the Atlantic”. The first fragrance of the house, named Royall Lyme, was brought to market in 1957 by Mr. Anthony J. Gaade, a renowned Bermuda yachtsman and competitor in international races.\nRoyall Lyme is a refreshing masculine fragrance blended from native West Indian limes, washed by pure island rains, by a recipe that origins from an old Caribbean formula, obtained from Harbor Islanders. The secret formula features a total of 78 ingredients. In 1960 Royall Lyme was introduced at Brooks Brothers New York and since then it became very popular. After that, it went international to London, Milan and beyond. Following the successes of Royall Lyme, Mr Gaade created other fragrances embodying the essence of Bermuda islands. Those fragrances are Royall Spyce, Royall Bay Rhum, and Royall Muske. Royall Mandarin joined the collection in 2001.\nThe original packaging for the Royall Fragrances is also reminiscent of the old Bermuda. The bottles are crafted of semi-hand-made glass from original clay molds with antimonial pewter-colored lead bron caps. A crown and a lime cluster are molded on each bottle. Each bottle also features the fragrance name and crown in raised glass on the back, with a distinctive colored label on the front. Fine parchment with a crown wax seal represents a finishing touch of the packaging. The seals are made with the same wax used by the Bank of England.\nMr. Gaade says: “In the Royall Family Fragrance, we believe we have a truly unique range of prestigious gentlemen's toiletries and grooming aids directed to the discerning user and carrying the Bermuda message overseas.”\nDesigner Royall Lyme Bermuda has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base. Royall Lyme Bermuda is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1957 and the newest is from 2016.",

From my childhood I spend hours in my workshop to create images, concepts, symbols that come from our world so visual and full of colors. But life is also full of scents, so it was like some years ago I discovered the existence of another world - the wonderful universe of fragrances - I started to create my own smells and develop the emotions they transmit. Until ideas took their level and brought these two arts together. I fused them, as if they were blood brothers. Thus were born my first plastic works that inspired perfumes or perfumes that motivated to paint a canvas. And in this way Renier Perfumes arose. It is about transmitting through the feelings that perceives the smell all the possible emotions inspired by a painting. Darkness, mystery, caution, suspense, abulia, longing, nudity, strength, love, rebirth, overcoming, are simply an example of the emotions that atomize my pictures - perfumes.

			"Royal Copenhagen (Royal Porcelain Factory) is a Danish porcelain manufacturer, founded in 1775. Its original headquarters were in Copenhagen.\nThe house was founded as the result of experiments with hard feldspar porcelain made from quartz by the pharmacist Frantz Heinrich Müller (1738-1820). The Queen Dowager Juliane Marie and her son Frederik partnered with Müller in 1775 to found the company. For almost a century, the Royal Danish Porcelain Manufactory was run by the Danish Royal Family.\nIn 1868 the company passed to private owners but still kept the name and the royal legacy of the brand. In 1882-84 the company joined with the Aluminia faience factory and moved from Copenhagen to Frederiksberg. Arnold Krog (1856-1931), painter and architect, was appointed as the manager with the task to revive the factory’s great original porcelain, Blue Fluted. He also developed a new technique for painting under the glaze, which made it possible to depict landscapes and other naturalistic graphics. This underglaze decorated porcelain made the company world famous since it was showed at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1889 and won the Grand Prix.\nToday, Royal Copenhagen is famous for its fine porcelain, hand-painted and manufactured by ancient methods. It is known worldwide for being Danish, for maintaining tradition but also excepting innovation. Royal Copenhagen operates in the US, EU and Asia and employs more than 500 people. The company is a part of the group of Scandinavian companies Royal Scandinavia and is owned by a private equity fund, Axcel.\nDesigner Royal Copenhagen has 8 perfumes in our fragrance base.

			"The Scent of Finland brand was conceived in 2018 out of concept at times referred to as The Fragrance of Memory, which, whilst highlighting the deep linkage between a smell and emotions, stipulates that a perfume can evoke the most vivid memories.\nIt is known that the brain stores memories through a network of neurons connected with one another. The more bonds are built among them, the stronger the memory is. It is this very fretwork that is what is known to be a memory. In the similar vein, the perfume is a representation of connections made between molecules which, when linked together, make up something that is more remarkable than when they are considered apart. It is thus possible to claim that a perfume is already a memory in itself, just waiting to be unveiled by someone to allow composing a memory in his brain.\nTherefore, taking inspirations from Finland’s most iconic places of wild nature tempered with the Nordic spirit and aesthetics we created this unique Eau de Perfum series. With the reference to one’s connection to scent memory the aim has been to serve those who visited the country with strong reminders of special moments of wonders and adventure experienced throughout their travel. Likewise, bringing the Scent of Finland as a gift allows one to share his emotions about the country with others through the art of fragrance.\nThe pure nature of Finland touches the soul. The unique lights, the green forests, the blue waters and the clean air keep calling you back.\nIn the meantime, always keep a part of Finland on you.\nScent of Finland is a new fragrance brand.

			'Theodoros Kalotinis (previously known as Theo Parfums) is a niche Greek natural perfume brand created by Theodoros Kalotinis in 2014. "Theodoros Kalotinis was born and grew up in Heraklion, Crete. Everything started early. From his school years his daily habit was to collect herbs and flowers for his herbarium. His love for nature and smells was developed too soon since he grew up with his grandmother who was a native of Smirni. \n\nAt the weekends, their favourite pastime activity was held in his grandma’s stuffed with herbs and spice kitchen where little blindfolded Theo had to recognize the herbs and the spice that were brought under his nose; In that way, he practiced the sense of smell and his childhood game became his dowry and a skill for life. \n\nDuring adolescence, he became a perfume collector. Some years later he wanted to create his personal perfume with substances from Greek Nature. So, he obtained essential oils and began testing.

Their products are inspired by the magic, beauty and nature of Ireland and they aim at offering the wonders of nature and uplifting spiritually. The products that represent Ireland include fine fragrances and premium soaps and toiletries, all packaged with bright colours and wonderful photography and messages.\nIn 1983 Brian Cox and Donald Pratt, founder of Avoca Handweavers, formed the idea to start an Irish perfume company. The first perfume they launched was "Innisfree" named after Yeats’ poem "The Lake Isle of Innisfree" .\nSince Innisfree brought a great success to the new company across Ireland and the USA, the first line for men was introduced shortly after - Patrick Cologne for Men A, along with a range of Irish soaps and toiletries.\nIn 1987 David Cox, Brian’s son, joined the company and helped with presentations and supply of perfumes. The perfume offer was growing constantly, the business was expending, so the company moved to new premises - converted an old dairy barn that was part of the Jameson Whiskey family estate in Kilmacanogue. Their address is still "Jameson’s Corner".\nMaster perfumer Arthur Burnham joined the team after david hired him to create the company’s perfume Inis. He had trained in Grasse for ten years alongside other perfumers such as Jacques Polge.\nInternational success in an international market was brought primarily by the perfume Inis. In about 10 years’ time over 1 million bottles of this exciting cologne for men and women have been sold.\nThe company is environment-aware so the line of Inis has been a core sponsor of the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, dedicated to the conservation and protection of Whales and Dolphins. Even the message on each carton of Inis says that no-one is an island, we are all connected. This is a way for the company to express their commitment to the environment and these wonderful creatures. The company further develops research of beneficial effects of seaweed extracts on the skin, which will help improve their skin creams and lotions.\nDesigner Fragrances of Ireland has 9 perfumes in our fragrance base. The earliest edition was created in 1998 and the newest is from 2011. The nose who worked on the fragrances is Arthur Burnham.',

The word “perfume” comes from the Latin per fume “through smoke”. This refers to the original use of fragrances – the burning of incense and herbs as a religious offering." - a note from the brand.\nEtry is a new fragrance brand.

		description:
			"Modern-day Dzintars was formed as a strong trunk with a wide crown, from four intertwisted sprouts which took root one and a half centuries ago. The history of Dzintars begins in the middle of the 19th century.\nA. Briger’s soap and perfumery factory was founded in Riga in 1849, producing soap, candles, and making perfume and Eau de Cologne using ready-made compositions from France. In the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, multiple small perfumery and cosmetics companies had sprung up in various Latvian towns. In 1940, several companies in the area were nationalized and transformed to soap and perfumery factory Sarcana Ausma (the former A. Briger’s factory), chemical, candle and tube factory Metra, perfumery factory Flora and tube-cosmetics factory Rota. From 1947 to 1951 the perfumery and cosmetics manufacturers were again reorganized, and Flora and Rota were liquidated in favor of larger companies Sarcana Ausma and Metra. In June 1951, the factory known as Metra was renamed as Dzintars. In 1958 Dzintars merged with soap factory Sarcana Ausma. The merged company retained the Dzintars name.\nProduction volume increased over time as a result of automation and mechanization. A new facility on the extreme edge of Riga was built, and core operations were moved into the new building in 1969. New equipment and mechanization in the early 1970s enabled the preparation and pouring of perfumery and cosmetic liquids, manufacturing of aluminum tubes, and preparation and packaging of creams and toothpastes. In January, 1976 the factory Dzintars changed its legal status as Riga’s Manufacturing Union of perfumery and cosmetics industry Dzintars. In October 1991, a decision was made to establish Dzintars as a Joint Stock Company, which was formalized by certificate on November 7, 1991. Today, having walked a long path of development and changes, the Dzintars company has become the largest manufacturer of biocosmetics and perfumery in the Baltics.\nDesigner Dzintars has 235 perfumes in our fragrance base. Dzintars is an old perfume house. The earliest edition was created in 1958 and the newest is from 2019. Dzintars fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Bronislava Schwarzman, Liesma Oše, Liliya Osipova, Meelda Gulbe and Aina Pashko.",

			'Auphorie, a portmanteau name from founders\' surnames, Au, and the French word, Euphorie (meaning euphoria), perfectly signifying its East-meets-West brand concept. Co-founded by Eugene Au and Emrys Au, Auphorie is one of the few independent luxury perfume houses which is founded and wholly owned by perfumers.\nAuphorie is a Maison de Parfum dedicated entirely to highly original luxury handcrafted perfumes and scent solutions, made in small batches using an eclectic selection of the finest natural extracts and innovative raw ingredients, with meticulous craftsmanship and an obsessive attention to details. At Auphorie, the founders continuously explore the world of scent with ingenuity, bridging the gap between the old (cultures, heritages, etc.) and the modern (technologies, interpretations, etc.), and create multisensory scent solutions that are luxurious, exquisite, and eccentric. Heavily inspired by cultures and heritages throughout the world, Eugene and Emrys compose the fragrances to evoke unique images and depictions of nostalgia and memories, resulting in fine fragrances that are modern in composition, yet rich in cultural roots.\nAs self-taught perfumers, the duo have always been fascinated by the world of scent. Before starting their own perfume house, they have both ventured into design industry and F&B businesses. Having an interior and product design background, Eugene is mostly responsible for the creative direction of the perfume house. Emrys who has an IT background, plays an important role in web and IT related works.\nWhile both of them have different backgrounds, Eugene and Emrys both share the same characteristics, i.e. they are in love with the world of scent. Their previous experiences as self-learned pastry and liquid chefs have trained them into olfactorily sensitive individuals. Flavor and scent matching skills combined with perfumery techniques, and with reference to cultures and history, the duo continuously develop their collections of fine fragrances and scent solutions.\nAuphorie fragrances are all handcrafted in the heart of tropical Asia, Malaysia. Eugene and Emrys source many precious natural extracts and essences from all over the world. A large proportion of natural ingredients goes into their fragrances which results in fragances that are "shibui", sophisticated, and hard to duplicate or mass produce. In the modern perfumery, most of the fragrances today are made using mostly synthetic molecules to replace those expensive natural essences. At Auphorie, however, the founders insist on blending their unique fragrances using many of the precious natural extracts, supported by a touch of genius aroma molecules.\nAt the heart of the brand\'s business is charitable giving. Eugene and Emrys are committed to building a luxury brand that embraces social responsibilities. They believe in the old saying, "The rose\'s in her hands, the flavor in mine." 10% of the profits will be donated to carefully selected charitable organization every month, hoping that it will help towards improving the lives of the underprivileged. With such initiative, the duo offer their clients an opportunity to scent themselves and improve their lifestyles by wearing the handcrafted fragrances and at the same time giving the roses of charity to those in need.\nDesigner Auphorie has 25 perfumes in our fragrance base. Auphorie is a new fragrance brand. The earliest edition was created in 2015 and the newest is from 2020. Auphorie fragrances were made in collaboration with perfumers Eugene Au and Emrys Au.',

Some profound bad luck coupled with some unfortunate decisions saw to it that Gustave Fragrifert never actually sold any of his own creations and because of this, his name and work were about to forgotten by history.\nAs luck would have it, in 2011, a century after Fragrifert went missing in the jungle of Borneo never to emerge again, some of his possessions were discovered in New Zealand where they made their way into the hands of budding perfumer Francesco van Eerd. Having just completed his training, van Eerd recognized the outstanding quality of Fragrifert’s formulations and, counting his lucky stars, realized that he found himself in the unique position of being able to rescue Gustave’s magnificent olfactory oeuvre from oblivion.\nThus two strands of the rich tapestry that is life came together at the right time to create Fragrifert Parfumeur, the artisan perfumery dedicated to showcasing and celebrating, finally after a full century, Gustave Fragrifert’s brilliant "perfumes that never were ..."\nDesigner Fragrifert Parfumeur has 9 perfumes in our fragrance base.

DoubleYou follows a conscientious and respectful production process, based on pure, natural ingredients, as we believe this is the only way to be true to our self and nature’s resources. This method requires more time and commitment when compared to an easy, cost-reducing synthetic approach, but the result, however, is extremely rewarding. The brand has a strong belief that the conscious consumer will recognize and appreciate the qualities that an approach like this gives back to the product and in turn to the customer.\nTo truly celebrate the senses one needs to understand their roots, their origins, and treat them with the same humility and respect as we need to apply to our relationship with other people as well as nature itself.\nInspired by a journey through Tanzania and Zanzibar in Autumn 2009, Cathrine Røsseland came up with the idea to create a sense-exploring collaborative project, that would capture the impressions and expressions of this memorable trip.\nGrowing up with her mother in mountainous Western Norway, Cathrine had always considered herself to be half-Norwegian and half-African. As Tanzania was the birthplace of her father, exploring her African side was a logical, though difficult exercise for her. When trying to make place for her African roots, it had always seemed as if she had to give up on some of her Norwegian identity. To her great surprise and joy, the trip made Cathrine discover that there was room for more than just the two halves, and that she was more whole as a person when allowing the African side to be included. She felt more than half-half, even more than whole, she felt double, and the name of the brand was born –\nDoubleYou."\nDoubleYou is a new fragrance brand.

His film was selected to submit for nomination in Cannes Film Festival by his advisor.

There, he finally had a chance to learn everything he always wanted to know about perfume. From traditional mixing to modern method.\nPrin came back to Thailand to work as a perfumer. Allow him to immerse himself in the art of perfume even more. In his free time, he would experiment with different combination of notes which he inspired from his trip to places. Later on, after years of experiment he decided to share his creation to the world.\nPRYN PARFUM launches in January 2016 as a narrative of his journeys. HIs passion in many kind of arts are combined into each of his perfume. Inspirations and stories inside each scent are other forms of his film.
